(a)  Legislative findings.--It is hereby determined and declared as a matter of legislative
            finding:  (1)  If the public is provided adequate notice and information about sexually violent predators
            and offenders as well as those sexually violent predators and offenders who do not
            have a fixed place of habitation or abode, the community can develop constructive
            plans to prepare itself for the release of sexually violent predators and offenders.
            This allows communities to meet with law enforcement to prepare and obtain information
            about the rights and responsibilities of the community and to provide education and
            counseling to their children.  (2)  These sexually violent predators and offenders pose a high risk of engaging in further
            offenses even after being released from incarceration or commitments, and protection
            of the public from this type of offender is a paramount governmental interest.  (3)  The penal and mental health components of our justice system are largely hidden from
            public view, and lack of information from either may result in failure of both systems
            to meet this paramount concern of public safety.  (4)  Overly restrictive confidentiality and liability laws governing the release of information
            about sexually violent predators and offenders have reduced the willingness to release
            information that could be appropriately released under the public disclosure laws
            and have increased risks to public safety.  (5)  Persons found to have committed a sexual offense have a reduced expectation of privacy
            because of the public's interest in public safety and in the effective operation of
            government.  (6)  Release of information about sexually violent predators and offenders to public agencies
            and the general public will further the governmental interests of public safety and
            public scrutiny of the criminal and mental health systems so long as the information
            released is rationally related to the furtherance of those goals.  (b)  Declaration of policy.--It is hereby declared to be the intention of the General Assembly
            to:  (1)  Protect the safety and general welfare of the people of this Commonwealth by providing
            for registration, community notification and access to information regarding sexually
            violent predators and offenders who are about to be released from custody and will
            live in or near their neighborhood.  (2)  Require the exchange of relevant information about sexually violent predators and
            offenders among public agencies and officials and to authorize the release of necessary
            and relevant information about sexually violent predators and offenders to members
            of the general public, including information available through the publicly accessible
            Internet website of the Pennsylvania State Police, as a means of assuring public protection
            and shall not be construed as punitive.  (3)  Address the Superior Court's opinion in the case of Commonwealth v. Wilgus, 975 A.2d
            1183 (2009), by requiring sexually violent predators and offenders without a fixed
            place of habitation or abode to register under this subchapter.  (4)  Address the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision in Commonwealth v. Muniz, No. 47
            MAP 2016 (Pa. 2016), and the Pennsylvania Superior Court's decision in Commonwealth
            v. Butler (2017 WL 3882445).  § 9799.52.  Scope.  This subchapter shall apply to individuals who were:  (1)  convicted of a sexually violent offense committed on or after April 22, 1996, but before December 20, 2012, whose period of registration with the Pennsylvania

            the registration.  (6)  Require the offender or sexually violent predator to read and sign a form stating

               under section 6352 (relating to disposition of delinquent child) after having been
               found delinquent for an act of sexual violence which if committed by an adult would
               be a violation of 18 Pa.C.S. § 3121 (relating to rape), 3123 (relating to involuntary

               of whether or not the child is in need of commitment due to a mental abnormality as

               of which results in serious difficulty in controlling sexually violent behavior, and

            board as designated by the administrative officer of the board shall conduct an assessment
            of the individual to determine if the relief sought, if granted, is likely to pose
            a threat to the safety of any other person. The board shall establish standards for
            evaluations and for evaluators conducting these assessments.  § 9799.59.  Exemption from certain notifications.  (a)  General rule.--An individual required to register under section 9799.55(a.1) and (b)

            to be exempt from the requirements of this subchapter, during which time the petitioner
            has not been convicted in this Commonwealth or any other jurisdiction or foreign country
            of an offense punishable by imprisonment of more than one year, or the petitioner's
            release from custody following the petitioner's most recent conviction for an offense,
            whichever is later.  (2)  Upon receipt of a petition filed under paragraph (1), the sentencing court shall enter
            an order directing that the petitioner be assessed by the board. Upon receipt from
            the court of an order for an assessment under this section, a member of the board
            designated by the administrative officer of the board shall conduct an assessment
            of the petitioner to determine if the relief sought, if granted, is likely to pose
            a threat to the safety of any other persons. The board shall establish standards for
            evaluations and for evaluators conducting assessments.  (3)  The order for an assessment under this section shall be sent to the administrative

            the requirements of this subchapter, at the discretion of the court, only upon a finding
            of clear and convincing evidence that exempting the petitioner from a particular requirement
            or all of the requirements of this subchapter is not likely to pose a threat to the
            safety of any other person.  (6)  A court granting relief under this section shall notify the Pennsylvania State Police
            in writing within 10 days from the date relief is granted.  (7)  The petitioner and the Commonwealth shall have the right to appellate review of the
            actions of the sentencing court under this section. An appeal by the Commonwealth

            of Victim Advocate shall notify the victim of the relief, in accordance with the memorandum
            of understanding, as specified in section 9799.61.  (8)  The petitioner may file an additional petition with the sentencing court no sooner
            than five years from the date of the final determination of a court regarding the
            petition and every five years thereafter.  (9)  If a petitioner is exempt from any provisions of this subchapter and the petitioner
            is subsequently convicted under 18 Pa.C.S. § 4915.2 (relating to failure to comply
            with 42 Pa.C.S. Ch. 97 Subch. I registration requirements), relief granted under this
            section shall be void, and the petitioner shall automatically and immediately again
            be subject to the provisions of this subchapter, as previously determined by this
            subchapter.  (b)  Agency cooperation.--All State, county and local agencies, offices and entities in

            residence. The local municipal police shall locate the offender or sexually violent
            predator and arrest the individual for violating this section. The Pennsylvania State
            Police shall assume responsibility for locating and arresting the offender or sexually
            violent predator in jurisdictions where no municipal police jurisdiction exists. The
            Pennsylvania State Police shall assist a municipal police department requesting assistance

            to comply with 42 Pa.C.S. Ch. 97 Subch. I registration requirements).  (f)  Effect of notice.--Neither failure on the part of the Pennsylvania State Police to
            send nor failure of a sexually violent predator or offender to receive notice or information
            under subsection (a.1), (b.1) or (b.3) shall relieve that predator or offender from
            the requirements of this subchapter.  § 9799.61.  Victim notification.  (a)  Duty to inform victim.--  (1)  Where the individual is determined to be a sexually violent predator by a court under
            section 9799.58 (relating to assessments), the local municipal police department or
            the Pennsylvania State Police where no municipal police jurisdiction exists shall
            give written notice to the sexually violent predator's victim when the sexually violent
            predator registers initially and when the sexually violent predator notifies the Pennsylvania
            State Police of a change of residence. In the case of a sexually violent predator
            who has a residence as defined in paragraph (1) of the definition of ""residence"" in
            section 9799.53 (relating to definitions), notice shall be given within 72 hours after

            of a change of address. The notice shall contain the sexually violent predator's name

            be given to the victim within 72 hours after the sexually violent predator registers
            or notifies the Pennsylvania State Police of a change of residence.  (2)  A victim may terminate the duty to inform described in paragraph (1) by providing
            the local municipal police department or the Pennsylvania State Police where no local
            municipal police department exists with a written statement releasing that agency
            from the duty to comply with this section as it pertains to that victim.  (b)  Where an individual is not determined to be a sexually violent predator.--Where an
            individual is not determined to be a sexually violent predator by a court under section
            9799.58, the victim shall be notified in accordance with section 201 of the act of
            November 24, 1998 (P.L.882, No.111), known as the Crime Victims Act. This subsection
            includes the circumstance of an offender having a residence as defined in paragraph

            violent predator lives in a common interest community, the term ""neighbor"" includes
            the unit owners' association and residents of the common interest community.  (2)  The director of the county children and youth service agency of the county where the
            sexually violent predator has a residence.  (3)  The superintendent of each school district and the equivalent official for private

            available, upon request, to the general public. The information may be provided by
            electronic means.  (e)  Interstate transfers.--The duties of police departments under this section shall also
            apply to individuals who are transferred to this Commonwealth under the Interstate
            Compact for the Supervision of Adult Offenders or the Interstate Compact for Juveniles.  § 9799.63.  Information made available on Internet and electronic notification.  (a)  Legislative findings.--It is hereby declared to be the finding of the General Assembly
            that public safety will be enhanced by making information about sexually violent predators,
            lifetime registrants and other sex offenders available to the public through the Internet
            and electronic notification. Knowledge of whether a person is a sexually violent predator,
            lifetime registrant or other sex offender could be a significant factor in protecting
            oneself and one's family members, or those in care of a group or community organization,
            from recidivist acts by sexually violent predators, lifetime registrants and other
            sex offenders. The technology afforded by the Internet and electronic notification
            would make this information readily accessible to parents and private entities, enabling
            them to undertake appropriate remedial precautions to prevent or avoid placing potential
            victims at risk. Public access to information about sexually violent predators, lifetime
            registrants and other sex offenders is intended solely as a means of public protection
            and shall not be construed as punitive.  (b)  Internet posting of sexually violent predators, lifetime registrants, other offenders
            and electronic notification.--The Commissioner of the Pennsylvania State Police shall,
            in the manner and form directed by the Governor:  (1)  Develop and maintain a system for making the information described in subsection (c)
            publicly available by electronic means so that the public may, without limitation,
            obtain access to the information via an Internet website to view an individual record
            or the records of all sexually violent predators, lifetime registrants and other offenders
            who are registered with the Pennsylvania State Police. The publicly accessible Internet
            website created under this subchapter and the information required to be posted under
            this subchapter shall be included on the publicly accessible Internet website created
            and maintained by the Pennsylvania State Police under Subchapter H (relating to registration
            of sexual offenders).  (2)  Ensure that the Internet website contains warnings that a person who uses the information
            contained on the Internet website to threaten, intimidate or harass another or who
            otherwise misuses that information may be criminally prosecuted.  (3)  Ensure that the Internet website contains:  (i)  An explanation of its limitations, including statements advising that a positive identification
            of a sexually violent predator, lifetime registrant or other offender whose record
            has been made available may be confirmed only by fingerprints.  (ii)  A statement that some information contained on the Internet website may be outdated
            or inaccurate.  (iii)  A statement that the Internet website is not a comprehensive listing of every person
            who has ever committed a sex offense in Pennsylvania.  (4)  Strive to ensure that:  (i)  the information contained on the Internet website is accurate;  (ii)  the data on the Internet website is revised and updated as appropriate in a timely
            and efficient manner; and  (iii)  instructions are included on how to seek correction of information which a person
            contends is erroneous.  (5)  Provide on the Internet website general information designed to inform and educate
            the public about sex offenders and sexually violent predators and the operation of
            this subchapter as well as pertinent and appropriate information concerning crime
            prevention and personal safety, with appropriate links to other relevant Internet
            websites operated by the Commonwealth.  (6)  Identify when the victim is a minor with a special designation. The identity of a
            victim of a sex offense shall not be published or posted on the Internet website.  (7)  Notwithstanding 18 Pa.C.S. Ch. 91 (relating to criminal history record information),
            develop, implement and maintain a process which allows members of the public to receive
            electronic notification when an individual required to register under this subchapter
            moves into or out of a user-designated location.  (c)  Information permitted to be disclosed regarding individuals.--Notwithstanding 18 Pa.C.S.
            Ch. 91, the Internet website shall contain the following information on each individual:  (1)  For sexually violent predators, the following information shall be posted on the Internet
            website:  (i)  name and all known aliases;  (ii)  year of birth;  (iii)  in the case of an individual who has a residence as defined in paragraph (1) of the
            definition of ""residence"" in section 9799.53 (relating to definitions), the street

            at which the person is enrolled as a student;  (v)  the municipality, county and zip code of an employment location;  (vi)  a photograph of the individual, which shall be updated not less than annually;  (vii)  a physical description of the offender, including sex, height, weight, eye color,
            hair color and race;  (viii)  identifying marks, including scars, birthmarks and tattoos;  (ix)  the license plate number and description of a vehicle owned or registered to the offender;  (x)  whether the offender is currently compliant with registration requirements;  (xi)  whether the victim is a minor;  (xii)  a description of the offense or offenses which triggered the application of this subchapter;  (xiii)  the date of the offense and conviction, if available; and  (xiv)  in the case of an individual who has a residence as defined in paragraph (2) of the
            definition of ""residence"" in section 9799.53, the information listed in section 9799.56(a)(2)(i)(C)
            (relating to registration procedures and applicability), including, where applicable,
            the name of the prison or other place of confinement.  (2)  For all other lifetime registrants and offenders subject to registration, the information
            specified in paragraph (1) shall be posted on the Internet website.  (d)  Duration of Internet posting.--  (1)  The information listed in subsection (c) about a sexually violent predator shall be
            made available on the Internet for the lifetime of the sexually violent predator.  (2)  The information listed in subsection (c) about an offender who is subject to lifetime
            registration shall be made available on the Internet for the lifetime of the offender
            unless the offender is granted relief under section 9799.59 (relating to exemption
            from certain notifications).  (3)  The information listed in subsection (c) about any other offender subject to registration
            shall be made available on the Internet for the entire period during which the offender
            is required to register, including an extension of this period under section 9799.56(a)(3).  § 9799.64.  Administration.  The Governor shall direct the Pennsylvania State Police, the Pennsylvania Board of
            Probation and Parole, the State Sexual Offenders Assessment Board, the Department
            of Corrections, the Department of Transportation and any other agency of this Commonwealth
            the Governor deems necessary to collaboratively design, develop and implement an integrated
            and secure system of communication, storage and retrieval of information to assure
            the timely, accurate and efficient administration of this subchapter.  § 9799.65.  Global positioning system technology.  The Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole and county probation authorities may
            impose supervision conditions that include offender tracking through global positioning
            system technology.  § 9799.66.  Immunity for good faith conduct.  The following entities shall be immune from liability for good faith conduct under

            in assault, further providing for probable cause arrests in domestic violence cases.    The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania hereby enacts as follows:    20180014u1s  Section 1.  Section 2711(a) and (c)(2) of Title 18 of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes are
            amended and the section is amended by adding subsections to read:  § 2711.  Probable cause arrests in domestic violence cases.  (a)  General rule.--A police officer shall have the same right of arrest without a warrant
            as in a felony whenever he has probable cause to believe the defendant has violated
            section 2504 (relating to involuntary manslaughter), 2701 (relating to simple assault),
            2702(a)(3), (4) and (5) (relating to aggravated assault), 2705 (relating to recklessly
            endangering another person), 2706 (relating to terroristic threats) [or] , 2709.1 (relating to stalking) or 2718 (relating to strangulation) against a family or household member although the offense did not take place in the
            presence of the police officer. A police officer may not arrest a person pursuant
            to this section without first observing recent physical injury to the victim or other
            corroborative evidence. For the purposes of this subsection, the term ""family or household
            member"" has the meaning given that term in 23 Pa.C.S. § 6102 (relating to definitions).  * * *  (c)  Bail.--  * * *  (2)  In determining whether to admit the defendant to bail, the issuing authority shall
            consider whether the defendant poses a threat of danger to the victim. In making a determination whether the defendant poses a threat of danger to the victim
               in cases under this section, the issuing authority may use a pretrial risk assessment
               tool as set forth in subsection (c.1). If the issuing authority makes such a determination, it shall require as a condition
            of bail that the defendant shall refrain from entering the residence or household
            of the victim and the victim's place of employment and shall refrain from committing
            any further criminal conduct against the victim and shall so notify the defendant
            thereof at the time the defendant is admitted to bail. Such condition shall expire
            at the time of the preliminary hearing or upon the entry or the denial of the protection
            of abuse order by the court, whichever occurs first. A violation of this condition
            may be punishable by the revocation of any form of pretrial release or the forfeiture
            of bail and the issuance of a bench warrant for the defendant's arrest or remanding
            him to custody or a modification of the terms of the bail. The defendant shall be
            provided a hearing on this matter.  (c.1)  Pretrial risk assessment tool.--The president judge of a court of common pleas may
            adopt a pretrial risk assessment tool for use by the court of common pleas or by the
            Philadelphia Municipal Court, the Pittsburgh Magistrates Court or magisterial district
            judges when acting as the issuing authority in cases under this section. The issuing
            authority may use the pretrial risk assessment tool to aid in determining whether
            the defendant poses a threat of danger to the victim. However, the pretrial risk assessment
            tool may not be the only means of determining whether to admit the defendant to bail.
            Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to conflict with the issuing authority's
            ability to determine whether to admit the defendant to bail under the Pennsylvania
            Rules of Criminal Procedure.  (c.2)  Pennsylvania Commission on Sentencing.--The following apply to the Pennsylvania Commission
            on Sentencing:  (1)  The commission shall develop a model pretrial risk assessment tool which may be used
            by the issuing authority in cases under this section, as set forth in subsection (c.1).  (2)  Subject to any inconsistent rule of court, in order to ensure that the model pretrial
            risk assessment tool or other pretrial risk assessment tool adopted under this section
            is effective, accurate and free from racial or economic bias, prior to the adoption
            of the tool, the commission shall publish a report of validation using information
            from cases from the judicial district where the tool is to be utilized. The report
            shall be updated every two years.  * * *  20180014u2s  Section 2.  This act shall take effect as follows:  (1)  The addition of 18 Pa.C.S. § 2711(c.2)(2) shall take effect in two years.

The General Assembly finds and declares as follows:  (1)  Maternal deaths are a serious public health concern and have a tremendous familial
            and societal impact. Maternal deaths are significantly underestimated and inadequately
            documented, preventing efforts to identify and reduce or eliminate the causes of death.  (2)  No processes exist in this Commonwealth for the confidential identification, investigation
            or dissemination of findings regarding maternal deaths.  (3)  There is a need to establish a maternal mortality review program to review maternal
            deaths and to develop strategies for the prevention of maternal deaths.  (4)  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that maternal deaths should
            be investigated through a State-based maternal mortality review committee in order
            to institute the systemic changes needed to decrease maternal mortality.  (5)  There is a need to establish a formal process for the confidential identification
            and investigation of individual cases followed by the dissemination of aggregated,
            nonindividually identifiable findings regarding maternal deaths in this Commonwealth.  (6)  There is a need to adopt programs, policies, recommendations and strategies based
            on collected data to prevent maternal deaths.  (7)  There is a need to provide public information and education regarding the incidence
            and causes of maternal deaths and the reduction of risks to health care providers
            and facilities, key government agencies and the public.  20180024u3s  Section 3.  Definitions.  The following words and phrases when used in this act shall have the meanings given

            jurisdiction or foreign country as a consequence of having been adjudicated delinquent
            for an offense similar to an offense which, if committed in this Commonwealth, would
            not require the individual to register shall register for a period of time equal to
            that required of the individual in the other jurisdiction or foreign country.  (5)  A sexually violent delinquent child shall register for the life of the individual.  (6)  A sexually violent predator shall register for the life of the individual.  (7)  An individual subject to registration under section 9799.13(7.1) shall register for

            requirement to appear on the publicly accessible Internet website maintained by the
            Pennsylvania State Police and all other requirements of this subchapter if:  (1)  Subject to subsection (c), at least 25 years have elapsed prior to filing a petition
            with the sentencing court to be exempt from the requirements of this subchapter, during
            which time the petitioner has not been convicted in this Commonwealth or any other
            jurisdiction or foreign country of an offense punishable by imprisonment of more than
            one year, or the petitioner's release from custody following the petitioner's most
            recent conviction for an offense, whichever is later.  (2)  Upon receipt of a petition filed under paragraph (1), the sentencing court shall enter
            an order directing that the petitioner be assessed by the board. Upon receipt from
            the court of an order for an assessment under this subsection, a member of the board
            designated by the administrative officer of the board shall conduct an assessment
            of the petitioner to determine if the relief sought, if granted, is likely to pose
            a threat to the safety of any other person. The board shall establish standards for
            evaluations and for evaluators conducting assessments.  (3)  The order for an assessment under this subsection shall be sent to the administrative
            officer of the board within 10 days of the entry. No later than 90 days following
            receipt of the order, the board shall submit a written report containing the board's
            assessment to the sentencing court, the district attorney and the attorney for the
            petitioner.  (4)  Within 120 days of filing the petition under paragraph (1), the sentencing court shall
            hold a hearing to determine whether to exempt the petitioner from the application
            of any or all of the requirements of this subchapter. The petitioner and the district
            attorney shall be given notice of the hearing and an opportunity to be heard, the
            right to call witnesses and the right to cross-examine witnesses. The petitioner shall
            have the right to counsel and to have a lawyer appointed to represent the petitioner
            if the petitioner cannot afford one.  (5)  The sentencing court shall exempt the petitioner from application of any or all of
            the requirements of this subchapter, at the discretion of the court, only upon a finding
            of clear and convincing evidence that exempting the sexual offender from a particular
            requirement or all of the requirements of this subchapter is not likely to pose a
            threat to the safety of any other person.  (6)  A court granting relief under this subsection shall notify the Pennsylvania State
            Police in writing within 10 days from the date the relief is granted. If a memorandum
            of understanding has been entered into under section 9799.26 (relating to victim notification)
            with respect to relief granted to the petitioner, the Pennsylvania State Police shall
            transmit the information about the relief to the Office of Victim Advocate as soon
            as is practicable. The Office of Victim Advocate shall notify the victim of the relief,
            in accordance with the memorandum of understanding, as described in section 9799.26.  (7)  The petitioner and the Commonwealth shall have the right to appellate review of the
            actions of the sentencing court under this subsection. An appeal by the Commonwealth
            shall stay the order of the sentencing court.  (8)  The petitioner may file an additional petition with the sentencing court no sooner
            than five years from the date of the final determination of a court regarding the
            petition and no sooner than every five years thereafter.  (9)  If the petitioner is exempt from any provisions of this subchapter and the petitioner
            is subsequently convicted under 18 Pa.C.S. § 4915.1 (relating to failure to comply
            with registration requirements), relief granted under this subsection shall be void
            and the petitioner shall automatically and immediately again be subject to the provisions
            of this subchapter, as previously determined by this subchapter.  (a.3)  Agency cooperation.--All State, county and local agencies, offices and entities in
            this Commonwealth, including juvenile probation officers, shall cooperate by providing

            finding:  (1)  If the public is provided adequate notice and information about sexually violent predators
            and offenders as well as those sexually violent predators and offenders who do not
            have a fixed place of habitation or abode, the community can develop constructive
            plans to prepare itself for the release of sexually violent predators and offenders.
            This allows communities to meet with law enforcement to prepare and obtain information
            about the rights and responsibilities of the community and to provide education and
            counseling to their children.  (2)  These sexually violent predators and offenders pose a high risk of engaging in further
            offenses even after being released from incarceration or commitments, and protection
            of the public from this type of offender is a paramount governmental interest.  (3)  The penal and mental health components of our justice system are largely hidden from
            public view, and lack of information from either may result in failure of both systems
            to meet this paramount concern of public safety.  (4)  Overly restrictive confidentiality and liability laws governing the release of information
            about sexually violent predators and offenders have reduced the willingness to release
            information that could be appropriately released under the public disclosure laws
            and have increased risks to public safety.  (5)  Persons found to have committed a sexual offense have a reduced expectation of privacy
            because of the public's interest in public safety and in the effective operation of
            government.  (6)  Release of information about sexually violent predators and offenders to public agencies
            and the general public will further the governmental interests of public safety and
            public scrutiny of the criminal and mental health systems so long as the information
            released is rationally related to the furtherance of those goals.  (b)  Declaration of policy.--It is hereby declared to be the intention of the General Assembly
            to:  (1)  Protect the safety and general welfare of the people of this Commonwealth by providing
            for registration, community notification and access to information regarding sexually
            violent predators and offenders who are about to be released from custody and will
            live in or near their neighborhood.  (2)  Require the exchange of relevant information about sexually violent predators and
            offenders among public agencies and officials and to authorize the release of necessary
            and relevant information about sexually violent predators and offenders to members
            of the general public, including information available through the publicly accessible
            Internet website of the Pennsylvania State Police, as a means of assuring public protection
            and shall not be construed as punitive.  (3)  Address the Superior Court's opinion in the case of Commonwealth v. Wilgus, 975 A.2d
            1183 (2009), by requiring sexually violent predators and offenders without a fixed
            place of habitation or abode to register under this subchapter.  (4)  Address the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision in Commonwealth v. Muniz, No. 47
            MAP 2016 (Pa. 2016), and the Pennsylvania Superior Court's decision in Commonwealth
            v. Butler (2017 WL 3882445).  § 9799.52.  Scope.  This subchapter shall apply to individuals who were:  (1)  convicted of a sexually violent offense committed on or after April 22, 1996, but

            be scheduled upon the praecipe filed by the district attorney. The district attorney
            upon filing a praecipe shall serve a copy of the same upon defense counsel together
            with a copy of the report of the board.  (2)  The individual and district attorney shall be given notice of the hearing and an opportunity
            to be heard, the right to call witnesses, the right to call expert witnesses and the
            right to cross-examine witnesses. In addition, the individual shall have the right
            to counsel and to have a lawyer appointed to represent the individual if he or she
            cannot afford one. If the individual requests another expert assessment, the individual
            shall provide a copy of the expert assessment to the district attorney prior to the
            hearing.  (3)  At the hearing prior to sentencing, the court shall determine whether the Commonwealth
            has proved by clear and convincing evidence that the individual is a sexually violent
            predator.  (4)  A copy of the order containing the determination of the court shall be immediately
            submitted to the individual, the district attorney, the Pennsylvania Board of Probation
            and Parole, the Department of Corrections, the board and the Pennsylvania State Police.  (f)  Presentence investigation.--In all cases where the board has performed an assessment
            under this section, copies of the report shall be provided to the agency preparing
            the presentence investigation.  (g)  Parole assessment.--The Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole may request of
            the board an assessment of an offender or sexually violent predator be conducted and
            provide a report to the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole prior to considering
            an offender or sexually violent predator for parole.  (h)  Delinquent children.--Except where section 6358(b.1) is applicable, the probation
            officer shall notify the board 90 days prior to the 20th birthday of the child of
            the status of the delinquent child who is committed to an institution or other facility
            under section 6352 (relating to disposition of delinquent child) after having been
            found delinquent for an act of sexual violence which if committed by an adult would
            be a violation of 18 Pa.C.S. § 3121 (relating to rape), 3123 (relating to involuntary
            deviate sexual intercourse), 3124.1 (relating to sexual assault), 3125 (relating to
            aggravated indecent assault), 3126 (relating to indecent assault) or 4302 (relating
            to incest), together with the location of the facility where the child is committed.
            The board shall conduct an assessment of the child, which shall include the board's
            determination of whether or not the child is in need of commitment due to a mental
            abnormality as defined in section 6402 (relating to definitions) or a personality
            disorder, either of which results in serious difficulty in controlling sexually violent
            behavior, and provide a report to the court within the time frames under section 6358(c).
            The probation officer shall assist the board in obtaining access to the child and
            records or information as requested by the board in connection with the assessment.
            The assessment shall be conducted under subsection (b).  (i)  Other assessments.--Upon receipt from the court of an order for an assessment under
            section 9799.59 (relating to exemption from certain notifications), a member of the
            board as designated by the administrative officer of the board shall conduct an assessment
            of the individual to determine if the relief sought, if granted, is likely to pose
            a threat to the safety of any other person. The board shall establish standards for
            evaluations and for evaluators conducting these assessments.  § 9799.59.  Exemption from certain notifications.  (a)  General rule.--An individual required to register under section 9799.55(a.1) and (b)
            (relating to registration) may be exempt from the requirement to register, the requirement
            to verify residence, employment and enrollment in an educational institution, the
            requirement to appear on the publicly accessible Internet website maintained by the
            Pennsylvania State Police and all other requirements of this subchapter if:  (1)  At least 25 years have elapsed prior to filing a petition with the sentencing court
            to be exempt from the requirements of this subchapter, during which time the petitioner
            has not been convicted in this Commonwealth or any other jurisdiction or foreign country
            of an offense punishable by imprisonment of more than one year, or the petitioner's
            release from custody following the petitioner's most recent conviction for an offense,
            whichever is later.  (2)  Upon receipt of a petition filed under paragraph (1), the sentencing court shall enter
            an order directing that the petitioner be assessed by the board. Upon receipt from
            the court of an order for an assessment under this section, a member of the board
            designated by the administrative officer of the board shall conduct an assessment
            of the petitioner to determine if the relief sought, if granted, is likely to pose
            a threat to the safety of any other persons. The board shall establish standards for
            evaluations and for evaluators conducting assessments.  (3)  The order for an assessment under this section shall be sent to the administrative
            officer of the board within 10 days of the entry. No later than 90 days following
            receipt of the order, the board shall submit a written report containing the board's
            assessment to the sentencing court, the district attorney and the attorney for the
            sexual offender.  (4)  Within 120 days of filing the petition under paragraph (1), the sentencing court shall
            hold a hearing to determine whether to exempt the petitioner from the application
            of any or all of the requirements of this subchapter. The petitioner and the district
            attorney shall be given notice of the hearing and an opportunity to be heard, the
            right to call witnesses and the right to cross-examine witnesses. The petitioner shall
            have the right to counsel and to have a lawyer appointed to represent the petitioner
            if the petitioner cannot afford one.  (5)  The sentencing court shall exempt the petitioner from application of any or all of
            the requirements of this subchapter, at the discretion of the court, only upon a finding
            of clear and convincing evidence that exempting the petitioner from a particular requirement
            or all of the requirements of this subchapter is not likely to pose a threat to the
            safety of any other person.  (6)  A court granting relief under this section shall notify the Pennsylvania State Police
            in writing within 10 days from the date relief is granted.  (7)  The petitioner and the Commonwealth shall have the right to appellate review of the
            actions of the sentencing court under this section. An appeal by the Commonwealth
            shall stay the order of the sentencing court. A court granting relief under this section
            shall notify the Pennsylvania State Police in writing within 10 days from the date
            the relief is granted. If a memorandum of understanding has been entered into under
            section 9799.61 (relating to victim notification) with respect to relief granted to
            the petitioner, the Pennsylvania State Police shall transmit the information about
            the relief to the Office of Victim Advocate as soon as is practicable. The Office
            of Victim Advocate shall notify the victim of the relief, in accordance with the memorandum
            of understanding, as specified in section 9799.61.  (8)  The petitioner may file an additional petition with the sentencing court no sooner
            than five years from the date of the final determination of a court regarding the
            petition and every five years thereafter.  (9)  If a petitioner is exempt from any provisions of this subchapter and the petitioner
            is subsequently convicted under 18 Pa.C.S. § 4915.2 (relating to failure to comply
            with 42 Pa.C.S. Ch. 97 Subch. I registration requirements), relief granted under this
            section shall be void, and the petitioner shall automatically and immediately again
            be subject to the provisions of this subchapter, as previously determined by this
            subchapter.  (b)  Agency cooperation.--All State, county and local agencies, offices and entities in
            this Commonwealth, including juvenile probation officers, shall cooperate by providing
            access to records and information as requested by the board in connection with the
            court-ordered assessment under subsection (a).  § 9799.60.  Verification of residence.  (a)  Quarterly verification by sexually violent predators.--The Pennsylvania State Police
            shall verify the residence and compliance with counseling as provided for in section
            9799.70 (relating to counseling of sexually violent predators) of sexually violent
            predators every 90 days through the use of a nonforwardable verification form to the
            last reported residence. For the period of registration required by section 9799.55
            (relating to registration), a sexually violent predator shall appear quarterly within
            10 days of the dates designated by the Pennsylvania State Police each calendar year

            and administer the verification process required by subsection (a) by:  (1)  sending a notice by first class United States mail to all registered sexually violent
            predators at their last reported residence addresses. This notice shall be sent not
            more than 30 days nor less than 15 days prior to each of the quarterly verification
            periods specified in subsection (a) and shall remind sexually violent predators of
            their quarterly verification requirement and provide them with a list of approved

            days nor less than 15 days prior to each offender's annual anniversary date and shall
            remind the offender of the annual verification requirement and provide the offender
            with a list of approved registration sites; and  (2)  providing verification and compliance forms as necessary to each approved registration
            site.  (b.2)  Monthly verification by individuals with temporary habitats located within this Commonwealth.--The
            Pennsylvania State Police shall verify the residence of individuals required to register
            under this subchapter who have a residence as defined in paragraph (2) of the definition
            of ""residence"" in section 9799.53 (relating to definitions) every 30 days through
            the use of a nonforwardable verification form to the last reported location where
            the individual receives mail. The individual shall appear every 30 days at an approved
            registration site to complete a verification form and to be photographed. The individual
            shall appear within three business days of the date designated by the Pennsylvania
            State Police.  (b.3)  Facilitation of monthly verification.--The Pennsylvania State Police shall facilitate
            and administer the verification process required by subsection (b.2) by:  (1)  sending a notice by first class United States mail to an individual required to register
            under this subchapter who has a residence as defined in paragraph (2) of the definition
            of ""residence"" in section 9799.53 at the last reported location where the individual
            receives mail. This notice shall be sent not more than 10 days nor less than five
            days prior to each of the monthly verification periods and shall remind the individual
            of the monthly verification requirement and provide a list of approved registration
            sites; and  (2)  providing verification and compliance forms as necessary to each approved registration
            site.  (c)  Notification of law enforcement agencies of change of residence.--A change of residence
            of an offender or sexually violent predator required to register under this subchapter
            reported to the Pennsylvania State Police shall be immediately reported by the Pennsylvania
            State Police to the appropriate law enforcement agency having jurisdiction of the
            offender's or the sexually violent predator's new place of residence. The Pennsylvania
            State Police shall, if the offender or sexually violent predator changes residence
            to another state, notify the law enforcement agency with which the offender or sexually
            violent predator must register in the new state.  (d)  Failure to provide verification.--Where an offender or sexually violent predator fails
            to provide verification of residence defined in paragraph (1) of the definition of
            ""residence"" in section 9799.53 within the 10-day period or three business days in
            the case of an offender or sexually violent predator who has a residence as defined
            in paragraph (2) of the definition of ""residence"" in section 9799.53, as specified
            in this section, the Pennsylvania State Police shall immediately notify the municipal
            police department of the offender's or the sexually violent predator's last verified
            residence. The local municipal police shall locate the offender or sexually violent
            predator and arrest the individual for violating this section. The Pennsylvania State
            Police shall assume responsibility for locating and arresting the offender or sexually
            violent predator in jurisdictions where no municipal police jurisdiction exists. The
            Pennsylvania State Police shall assist a municipal police department requesting assistance
            with locating and arresting an offender or sexually violent predator who fails to
            verify the offender's or sexually violent predator's residence.  (e)  Penalty.--An individual subject to registration under section 9799.55(a) or (b) who
            fails to verify the individual's residence or to be photographed as required by this
            section may be subject to prosecution under 18 Pa.C.S. § 4915.2 (relating to failure
            to comply with 42 Pa.C.S. Ch. 97 Subch. I registration requirements).  (f)  Effect of notice.--Neither failure on the part of the Pennsylvania State Police to
            send nor failure of a sexually violent predator or offender to receive notice or information
            under subsection (a.1), (b.1) or (b.3) shall relieve that predator or offender from
            the requirements of this subchapter.  § 9799.61.  Victim notification.  (a)  Duty to inform victim.--  (1)  Where the individual is determined to be a sexually violent predator by a court under
            section 9799.58 (relating to assessments), the local municipal police department or
            the Pennsylvania State Police where no municipal police jurisdiction exists shall
            give written notice to the sexually violent predator's victim when the sexually violent
            predator registers initially and when the sexually violent predator notifies the Pennsylvania
            State Police of a change of residence. In the case of a sexually violent predator
            who has a residence as defined in paragraph (1) of the definition of ""residence"" in
            section 9799.53 (relating to definitions), notice shall be given within 72 hours after
            the sexually violent predator registers or notifies the Pennsylvania State Police
            of a change of address. The notice shall contain the sexually violent predator's name
            and the address or addresses where the individual has a residence. In the case of
            a sexually violent predator who has a residence as defined in paragraph (2) of the
            definition of ""residence"" in section 9799.53, the notice shall contain the sexually
            violent predator's name and the information specified in section 9799.56(a)(2)(i)(A)
            and (B) (relating to registration procedures and applicability). The notice shall
            be given to the victim within 72 hours after the sexually violent predator registers
            or notifies the Pennsylvania State Police of a change of residence.  (2)  A victim may terminate the duty to inform described in paragraph (1) by providing
            the local municipal police department or the Pennsylvania State Police where no local
            municipal police department exists with a written statement releasing that agency
            from the duty to comply with this section as it pertains to that victim.  (b)  Where an individual is not determined to be a sexually violent predator.--Where an
            individual is not determined to be a sexually violent predator by a court under section
            9799.58, the victim shall be notified in accordance with section 201 of the act of
            November 24, 1998 (P.L.882, No.111), known as the Crime Victims Act. This subsection
            includes the circumstance of an offender having a residence as defined in paragraph
            (2) of the definition of ""residence"" in section 9799.53.  (c)  Alternate means of notifying victims.--  (1)  The Pennsylvania State Police may enter into a memorandum of understanding with the
            Office of Victim Advocate to assist the Pennsylvania State Police in notifying victims
            and providing the information under subsection (a). In addition, the memorandum of
            understanding may also include the Office of Victim Advocate's notifying a victim
            of relief granted to a petitioner under section 9799.59 (relating to exemption from
            certain notifications). The memorandum of understanding must set forth the manner
            and method of notifying victims and the duties of the Pennsylvania State Police and
            the Office of Victim Advocate under this section and section 9799.59(a). A memorandum
            of understanding entered into under this subsection shall be valid for no more than
            10 years. There shall be no limit to the number of memoranda of understanding which
            may be executed by the Pennsylvania State Police and the Office of Victim Advocate
            under this subsection.  (2)  As used in this subsection, the term ""Office of Victim Advocate"" shall mean the office
            established under section 301 of the Crime Victims Act.  § 9799.62.  Other notification.  (a)  Notice by municipality's chief law enforcement officer.--Notwithstanding any of the
            provisions of 18 Pa.C.S. Ch. 91 (relating to criminal history record information),
            the chief law enforcement officer of the full-time or part-time police department
            of the municipality where a sexually violent predator lives shall be responsible for
            providing written notice as required under this section.  (1)  The notice shall contain:  (i)  The name of the convicted sexually violent predator.  (ii)  The address or addresses at which the sexually violent predator has a residence. If,
            however, the sexually violent predator has a residence as defined in paragraph (2)
            of the definition of ""residence"" in section 9799.53 (relating to definitions), the
            notice shall be limited to that provided for under section 9799.56(a)(2)(i)(C) (relating
            to registration procedures and applicability).  (iii)  The offense for which the sexually violent predator was convicted, sentenced by a
            court, adjudicated delinquent or court martialed.  (iv)  A statement that the individual has been determined by court order to be a sexually
            violent predator, which determination has or has not been terminated as of a date
            certain.  (v)  A photograph of the sexually violent predator, if available.  (2)  The notice shall not include information that might reveal the victim's name, identity
            and residence.  (b)  To whom written notice is provided.--The chief law enforcement officer shall provide
            written notice, under subsection (a), to the following persons:  (1)  Neighbors of the sexually violent predator. As used in this paragraph, where the sexually
            violent predator lives in a common interest community, the term ""neighbor"" includes
            the unit owners' association and residents of the common interest community.  (2)  The director of the county children and youth service agency of the county where the
            sexually violent predator has a residence.  (3)  The superintendent of each school district and the equivalent official for private
            and parochial schools enrolling students up through grade 12 in the municipality where
            the sexually violent predator has a residence.  (3.1)  The superintendent of each school district and the equivalent official for each private
            and parochial school located within a one-mile radius of where the sexually violent
            predator has a residence.  (4)  The licensee of each certified day-care center and licensed preschool program and
            owner/operator of each registered family day-care home in the municipality where the
            sexually violent predator has a residence.  (5)  The president of each college, university and community college located within 1,000
            feet of a sexually violent predator's residence.  (c)  Urgency of notification.--The municipal police department's chief law enforcement
            officer shall provide notice within the following time frames:  (1)  To neighbors, notice shall be provided within five days after information of the sexually
            violent predator's release date and residence has been received by the chief law enforcement
            officer. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (b), verbal notification
            may be used if written notification would delay meeting this time requirement.  (2)  To the persons specified in subsection (b)(2), (3), (4) and (5), notice shall be provided
            within seven days after the chief law enforcement officer receives information regarding
            the sexually violent predator's release date and residence.  (d)  Public notice.--All information provided in accordance with subsection (a) shall be
            available, upon request, to the general public. The information may be provided by
            electronic means.  (e)  Interstate transfers.--The duties of police departments under this section shall also
            apply to individuals who are transferred to this Commonwealth under the Interstate
            Compact for the Supervision of Adult Offenders or the Interstate Compact for Juveniles.  § 9799.63.  Information made available on Internet and electronic notification.  (a)  Legislative findings.--It is hereby declared to be the finding of the General Assembly
            that public safety will be enhanced by making information about sexually violent predators,
            lifetime registrants and other sex offenders available to the public through the Internet
            and electronic notification. Knowledge of whether a person is a sexually violent predator,
            lifetime registrant or other sex offender could be a significant factor in protecting
            oneself and one's family members, or those in care of a group or community organization,
            from recidivist acts by sexually violent predators, lifetime registrants and other
            sex offenders. The technology afforded by the Internet and electronic notification
            would make this information readily accessible to parents and private entities, enabling
            them to undertake appropriate remedial precautions to prevent or avoid placing potential
            victims at risk. Public access to information about sexually violent predators, lifetime
            registrants and other sex offenders is intended solely as a means of public protection
            and shall not be construed as punitive.  (b)  Internet posting of sexually violent predators, lifetime registrants, other offenders
            and electronic notification.--The Commissioner of the Pennsylvania State Police shall,
            in the manner and form directed by the Governor:  (1)  Develop and maintain a system for making the information described in subsection (c)
            publicly available by electronic means so that the public may, without limitation,
            obtain access to the information via an Internet website to view an individual record
            or the records of all sexually violent predators, lifetime registrants and other offenders
            who are registered with the Pennsylvania State Police. The publicly accessible Internet
            website created under this subchapter and the information required to be posted under

            use until either a creditor or municipality acquires title to the real estate.  (3)  An accelerated procedure is needed to maintain the due process rights of owners of
            real estate and to reduce unnecessary delays in an action of mortgage foreclosure

            integrated employment for individuals with a disability.  (7)  Hundreds of thousands of job openings are listed every day, reflecting the challenges

            by adding a section to read:  Section 216.  Coordinated Service Delivery Pilot Program.--(a)  To the extent permitted by Federal law, the department, in consultation with the Department
            of Education, shall establish a pilot program at a school entity or entities within
            the city of the first class to assist in the coordinated delivery of education services
            and human services to students and their families for the purposes of promoting and
            implementing innovative research-based practices within selected school entities.
            Coordination shall be based upon joint planning between the department, the Department
            of Education and a school entity's comprehensive assessments of the need to provide
            services, coordinate service delivery, close gaps in services and coordinate to address
            the provision of needed services. In order to assist in the coordinated delivery of
            education services and human services to students and their families, the pilot program
            may consider the following:  (1)  A school entity assisting students and their families in applying for and receiving
            education services and human services.  (2)  An expanded school day for the purpose of providing opportunities for increased instructional
            time, tutoring by staff, pupils and volunteers, an environment conducive to learning
            before and after the regular school day and personalized instruction and mentoring.  (3)  Other best practices as determined by the department and the Department of Education.  (b)  A school entity participating in the pilot program shall submit reports to the department

            department.  (c)  As used in this section, the term ""s chool entity"" shall mean any public school, including a charter school or cyber charter
               school or area vocational-technical school operating within this Commonwealth.  20180040u2s  Section 2.  Sections 408(b) and 443.1(7)(vi) of the act are amended to read:  Section 408.  Meeting Special Needs; Work Supports and Incentives.--* * *  (b)  The department may provide assistance to recipients for child [day] care when the
            department has determined that , without such services , the recipient would be exempt from compliance with the conditions of the agreement
            of mutual responsibility or work requirements or when a former recipient who is employed
            has ceased to receive cash assistance for a reason other than a sanction for noncompliance
            with an eligibility condition. In establishing the time limits and levels of access
            to child [day-care] care funds, the department shall take into account availability, costs and the number
            of assistance groups needing services within the geographic area and shall seek to
            provide essential services to the greatest number of recipients.  * * *  Section 443.1.  Medical Assistance Payments for Institutional Care.--The following medical assistance
            payments shall be made on behalf of eligible persons whose institutional care is prescribed
            by physicians:  * * *  (7)  After June 30, 2007, payments to county and nonpublic nursing facilities enrolled
            in the medical assistance program as providers of nursing facility services shall
            be determined in accordance with the methodologies for establishing payment rates
            for county and nonpublic nursing facilities specified in the department's regulations
            and the Commonwealth's approved Title XIX State Plan for nursing facility services
            in effect after June 30, 2007. The following shall apply:  * * *  (vi)  Subject to Federal approval of such amendments as may be necessary to the Commonwealth's
            approved Title XIX State Plan, for fiscal years 2015-2016 [and] , 2016-2017 and 2018-2019 , the department shall make up to four medical assistance day-one incentive payments
            to qualified nonpublic nursing facilities. The department shall determine the nonpublic
            nursing facilities that qualify for the medical assistance day-one incentive payments
            and calculate the payments using the total Pennsylvania medical assistance (PA MA)
            days and total resident days as reported by nonpublic nursing facilities under Article
            VIII-A. The department's determination and calculations under this subparagraph shall
            be based on the nursing facility assessment quarterly resident day reporting forms,
            as determined by the department. The department shall not retroactively revise a medical
            assistance day-one incentive payment amount based on a nursing facility's late submission
            or revision of the department's report after the dates designated by the department.
            The department, however, may recoup payments based on an audit of a nursing facility's
            report. The following shall apply:  (A)  A nonpublic nursing facility shall meet all of the following criteria to qualify for
            a medical assistance day-one incentive payment:  (I)  The nursing facility shall have an overall occupancy rate of at least eighty-five
            percent during the resident day quarter. For purposes of determining a nursing facility's
            overall occupancy rate, a nursing facility's total resident days, as reported by the
            facility under Article VIII-A, shall be divided by the product of the facility's licensed
            bed capacity, at the end of the quarter, multiplied by the number of calendar days
            in the quarter.  (II)  The nursing facility shall have a medical assistance occupancy rate of at least sixty-five
            percent during the resident day quarter. For purposes of determining a nursing facility's
            medical assistance occupancy rate, the nursing facility's total PA MA days shall be
            divided by the nursing facility's total resident days, as reported by the facility
            under Article VIII-A.  (III)  The nursing facility shall be a nonpublic nursing facility for a full resident day
            quarter prior to the applicable quarterly reporting due dates, as determined by the
            department.  (B)  The department shall calculate a qualified nonpublic nursing facility's medical assistance
            day-one incentive payment as follows:  (I)  The total funds appropriated for payments under this subparagraph shall be divided
            by the number of payments, as determined by the department.  (II)  To establish the per diem rate for a payment, the amount under subclause (I) shall
            be divided by the total PA MA days, as reported by all qualifying nonpublic nursing
            facilities under Article VIII-A for that payment.  (III)  To determine a qualifying nonpublic nursing facility's medical assistance day-one
            incentive payment, the per diem rate calculated for the payment shall be multiplied
            by a nonpublic nursing facility's total PA MA days, as reported by the facility under
            Article VIII-A for the payment.  (C)  For fiscal years 2015-2016 [and] , 2016-2017 and 2018-2019 , the State funds available for the nonpublic nursing facility medical assistance
            day-one incentive payments shall equal eight million dollars ($8,000,000).  * * *  20180040u3s  Section 3.  The act is amended by adding a section to read:  Section 443.12.  Nonemergency Medical Transportation Services.--(a)  The department shall amend the Commonwealth's State Plan under Title XIX of the Social
            Security Act (49 Stat. 620, 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq.) to provide nonemergency medical
            transportation services to eligible and enrolled medical assistance recipients utilizing
            a Statewide or regional full-risk brokerage model.  (b)  Subject to Federal approval of the amendments to the Commonwealth's approved Title
            XIX State Plan, the department shall develop a proposal and solicit a broker to administer
            the program. A broker determined eligible by the department may submit a proposal.
            The department shall enter into a contract with each broker whose proposal has been
            selected to administer the program.  (c)  The department shall issue the solicitation for a Statewide or regional full-risk
            brokerage model within one hundred eighty days after the effective date of this subsection.  20180040u3.1s  Section 3.1.  The act is amended by adding an article to read:  ARTICLE V-A  HEALTH CARE OUTCOMES  SUBARTICLE A  PRELIMINARY PROVISIONS  Section 501-A.  Definitions.

            has identified a decrease in the number of claim payments and the decline in the need
            in this Commonwealth for the types of medical professional liability insurance policies
            offered by the association under Chapter 7 of the Mcare Act. The review has identified
            a need to modernize the association in order to produce needed economical and administrative
            efficiencies.  (2)  Ensuring the future availability of and access to quality health care is a fundamental
            government goal, and it is essential to the public health, safety and welfare of all

            and to highly trained physicians in all specialties is available.  (3)  In order to accomplish the goals under paragraph (2), medical professional liability
            insurance must continue to be obtainable at an affordable and reasonable cost in every
            geographic region of this Commonwealth. Placing the association within the department

            Multimodal Transportation Fund;  In school district debt refinancing bonds:  further providing for sinking fund charges for school building; providing for reinstatement
            of item vetoes; repealing provisions relating to 2013-2014 budget implementation and
            2013-2014 restrictions on appropriations for funds and accounts; providing for 2018-2019
            budget implementation and 2018-2019 restrictions on appropriations for funds and accounts;
            and making related repeals.    The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania hereby enacts as follows:    20180042u1s  Section 1.  The General Assembly finds and declares as follows:  (1)  The intent of this act is to provide for the implementation of the 2018-2019 Commonwealth
            budget.  (2)  The Constitution of Pennsylvania confers numerous express duties upon the General
            Assembly, including the passage of a balanced budget for the Commonwealth.  (3)  Section 24 of Article III of the Constitution of Pennsylvania requires the General
            Assembly to adopt all appropriations for the operation of government in this Commonwealth,
            regardless of their source. The Supreme Court has repeatedly affirmed that ""It is
            fundamental within Pennsylvania's tripartite system that the General Assembly enacts
            the legislation establishing those programs which the State provides for its citizens
            and appropriates the funds necessary for their operation.""  (4)  Pursuant to section 13 of Article VIII of the Constitution of Pennsylvania, the General
            Assembly is explicitly required to adopt a balanced Commonwealth budget. Given the
            unpredictability and potential insufficiency of revenue collections, various changes
            in State law relating to sources of revenue, the collection of revenue and the implementation
            of statutes which impact revenue may be required to discharge this constitutional
            obligation.  (5)  Section 11 of Article III of the Constitution of Pennsylvania requires the adoption
            of a general appropriation act that embraces ""nothing but appropriations."" While actual
            items of appropriation can be contained in a General Appropriation Act, the achievement
            and implementation of a comprehensive budget involves more than subjects of appropriations
            and dollar amounts. Ultimately, the budget has to be balanced under section 13 of
            Article VIII of the Constitution of Pennsylvania. This may necessitate changes to
            sources of funding and enactment of statutes to achieve full compliance with these
            constitutional provisions.  (6)  For the reasons set forth in paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5), it is the intent
            of the General Assembly through this act to provide for the implementation of the
            2018-2019 Commonwealth budget.  (7)  Every provision of this act relates to the implementation of the operating budget
            of the Commonwealth for this fiscal year, addressing in various ways the fiscal operations,
            revenues and potential liabilities of the Commonwealth. To that end, this act is intended
            to implement the 2018-2019 Commonwealth budget without specifically appropriating
            public money from the General Fund. This act provides accountability for spending
            and makes transfers or other changes necessary to impact the availability of revenue
            in order to meet the requirements of section 13 of Article VIII of the Constitution
            of Pennsylvania and to implement the act of June 22, 2018 (P.L.1203, No.1A), known
            as the General Appropriation Act of 2018.  20180042u1.1s  Section 1.1.  The title of the act of April 9, 1929 (P.L.343, No.176), known as The Fiscal Code,
            amended October 30, 2017 (P.L.725, No.44), is amended to read:  AN ACT  Relating to the finances of the State government; providing for cancer control, prevention

               and for reinstatement of item vetoes; providing for the settlement, assessment, collection, and lien of taxes, bonus, and
            all other accounts due the Commonwealth, the collection and recovery of fees and other
            money or property due or belonging to the Commonwealth, or any agency thereof, including
            escheated property and the proceeds of its sale, the custody and disbursement or other
            disposition of funds and securities belonging to or in the possession of the Commonwealth,
            and the settlement of claims against the Commonwealth, the resettlement of accounts
            and appeals to the courts, refunds of moneys erroneously paid to the Commonwealth,
            auditing the accounts of the Commonwealth and all agencies thereof, of all public
            officers collecting moneys payable to the Commonwealth, or any agency thereof, and
            all receipts of appropriations from the Commonwealth, authorizing the Commonwealth
            to issue tax anticipation notes to defray current expenses, implementing the provisions
            of section 7(a) of Article VIII of the Constitution of Pennsylvania authorizing and
            restricting the incurring of certain debt and imposing penalties; affecting every
            department, board, commission, and officer of the State government, every political
            subdivision of the State, and certain officers of such subdivisions, every person,
            association, and corporation required to pay, assess, or collect taxes, or to make

            and every debtor or creditor of the Commonwealth.  20180042u2s  Section 2.  Section 232-A(b) of the act is amended to read:  Section 232-A.  Preemption.--* * *  (b)  This section shall not apply to any ordinance or regulation adopted by a city of the first class[.] prior to June 1, 2018, regarding or affecting the sale of tobacco products by dealers

               by a city of the first class. Nothing in this subsection may be construed to prohibit
               a city of the first class from enacting or amending an ordinance requiring tobacco
               products to be maintained behind a counter and under the exclusive control of the
               retailer or employee of the retailer prior to purchase, provided that the ordinance may not apply to retail stores

            Marijuana Act, is amended to read:  CHAPTER 20  ACADEMIC CLINICAL RESEARCH CENTERS AND CLINICAL REGISTRANTS  20180043u2s  Section 2.  The act is amended by adding a section to read:  Section 2000.  Legislative findings and declaration of policy.  (a)  Legislative findings.--It is determined and declared as a matter of legislative finding:  (1)  Patients suffering from serious medical conditions deserve the benefit of research
            conducted in conjunction with the Commonwealth's medical schools to determine whether
            medical marijuana will improve their conditions or symptoms.  (2)  The Commonwealth has an interest in creating a mechanism whereby the Commonwealth's
            medical schools and hospitals can help develop research programs and studies in compliance
            with applicable law.  (b)  Declaration of policy.--The General Assembly declares as follows:  (1)  It is the intention of the General Assembly to create a mechanism whereby this Commonwealth's
            medical schools and hospitals may provide advice to grower/processors and dispensaries
            in the areas of patient health and safety, medical applications and dispensing and
            management of controlled substances, among other areas. It is the further intention
            of the General Assembly to create a mechanism whereby the Commonwealth may encourage
            research associated with medical marijuana.  (2)  It is the policy of the Commonwealth to allow, in addition to the 25 grower/processors
            and 50 dispensaries initially authorized under section 616, the operation of additional
            grower/processors and dispensaries which will be approved by the department as clinical
            registrants. A clinical registrant is a grower/processor and a dispensary which has
            a contractual relationship with a medical school that operates or partners with a
            hospital to provide advice about medical marijuana so that patient safety may be enhanced.  20180043u3s  Section 3.  Section 2001 of the act is amended to read:  Section 2001.  Definitions.  The following words and phrases when used in this chapter shall have the meanings

               the department, including information for the individual who will be the primary contact

               clinical research center by the department.  (b)  Posting and publication of list.--The department shall post a list containing the
            name and address of each certified academic clinical research center on the department's

            a clinical registrant.  (3)  An entity seeking approval as a clinical registrant that does not already hold a permit
            as a grower/processor or a dispensary shall submit the applications required under

The General Assembly finds and declares as follows:  (1)  Over the past several years, school shootings have become more frequent. The recent
            school shootings have shown the need for robust information sharing and communication
            between schools and law enforcement. The communication is necessary to prevent school
            violence.  (2)  It is vital that the Commonwealth take available measures to create safe and welcoming
            school communities. Providing students, teachers and communities with an anonymous
            reporting mechanism is a proven important tool in creating safe and welcoming school
            communities.  (3)  It is the intent of the General Assembly that the Safe2Say Program be a one-stop shop
            for students, teachers and community members to report behavior perceived to be threatening
            to an individual or a school entity. Reports made through the anonymous reporting
            system will be referred to local schools, law enforcement and/or organizations.  (4)  The intent of the General Assembly is for the Safe2Say Program to supplement, not
            replace, 911 services. The Safe2Say Program is intended to facilitate increased communication
            between law enforcement, school districts and organizations.  (5)  It is not the intent of the General Assembly that the Safe2Say Program be used as
            a disciplinary tool for school employees. However, there may be instances where information
            obtained through the program may be shared with and used by school officials.  (6)  The Safe2Say Program is not meant to be a tool for law enforcement. However, there
            may be instances where information obtained through the program may be shared with
            and used by law enforcement.  Section 1302-D.  Definitions.  The following words and phrases when used in this article shall have the meanings

            including the grading and counts thereof which the child is found to have committed.
            The court shall then proceed immediately or at a postponed hearing, which shall occur
            not later than 20 days after such finding if the child is in detention or not more
            than 60 days after such finding if the child is not in detention, to hear evidence
            as to whether the child is in need of treatment, supervision or rehabilitation , as established by a preponderance of the evidence, and to make and file its findings thereon. This time limitation may only be extended
            pursuant to the agreement of the child and the attorney for the Commonwealth. The
            court's failure to comply with the time limitations stated in this section shall not
            be grounds for discharging the child or dismissing the proceeding. In the absence
            of evidence to the contrary, evidence of the commission of acts which constitute a
            felony shall be sufficient to sustain a finding that the child is in need of treatment,
            supervision or rehabilitation. If the court finds that the child is not in need of
            treatment, supervision or rehabilitation it shall dismiss the proceeding and discharge
            the child from any detention or other restriction theretofore ordered.  * * *  20180049u3s  Section 3.  This act shall take effect in 60 days.    APPROVED--The 28th day of June, A.D. 2018.    TOM WOLF   "

            of an initial motion to the court under this subchapter must be served in the manner
            provided by law for the service of a summons in a civil action. Otherwise, notice
            of the motion must be given in the manner provided by law or rule of court for serving
            motions in pending cases.  § 7321.7.  Validity of agreement to arbitrate.  (a)  General rule.--An agreement contained in a record to submit to arbitration any existing
            or subsequent controversy arising between the parties to the agreement is valid, enforceable
            and irrevocable except upon a ground that exists at law or in equity for the revocation
            of a contract.  (b)  Court decision.--The court shall decide whether an agreement to arbitrate exists or
            a controversy is subject to an agreement to arbitrate.  (c)  Arbitrator decision.--An arbitrator shall decide whether a condition precedent to
            arbitrability has been fulfilled and whether a contract containing a valid agreement
            to arbitrate is enforceable.  (d)  Challenge to arbitration.--If a party to a judicial proceeding challenges the existence
            of, or claims that a controversy is not subject to, an agreement to arbitrate, the
            arbitration proceeding may continue pending final resolution of the issue by the court,
            unless the court otherwise orders.  (e)  Grounds for validity and enforceability.--  (1)  Subject to paragraph (2), in determining the validity and enforceability of an agreement
            to arbitrate, a court may consider any grounds that exist at law or in equity for
            the revocation of a contract, regardless of whether arising out of Federal or State
            law or as a matter of public policy, that are applicable to other contracts, including
            fraud, duress, coercion, unconscionability or the imposition by a contract of adhesion
            of any requirement that unreasonably favors the party that imposed the provision.  (2)  Paragraph (1) shall not apply in any manner prohibited by 9 U.S.C. (relating to arbitration)
            or other Federal law.  § 7321.8.  Motion to compel or stay arbitration.  (a)  Refusal to arbitrate under agreement.--On motion of a person showing an agreement
            to arbitrate and alleging another person's refusal to arbitrate under the agreement:  (1)  if the refusing party does not appear or does not oppose the motion, the court shall
            order the parties to arbitrate; and  (2)  if the refusing party opposes the motion, the court shall proceed summarily to decide
            the issue and order the parties to arbitrate unless it finds that there is no enforceable
            agreement to arbitrate.  (b)  Agreement challenged.--On motion of a person alleging that an arbitration proceeding
            has been initiated or threatened but that there is no agreement to arbitrate, the
            court shall proceed summarily to decide the issue. If the court finds that there is
            an enforceable agreement to arbitrate, the court shall order the parties to arbitrate.  (c)  Enforceable agreement required.--If the court finds that there is no enforceable agreement,
            the court may not, under subsection (a) or (b), order the parties to arbitrate.  (d)  Court refusal.--The court may not refuse to order arbitration because the claim subject
            to arbitration lacks merit or grounds for the claim have not been established.  (e)  Appropriate court.--If a proceeding involving a claim referable to arbitration under
            an alleged agreement to arbitrate is pending in court, a motion under this section
            must be made in that court. Otherwise, a motion under this section may be made in
            any court as provided in section 7321.28 (relating to venue).  (f)  Stay of judicial proceedings.--An action or proceeding allegedly involving an issue
            subject to arbitration shall be stayed if a court order to proceed with arbitration
            has been made or a motion for such an order has been made under this section. If the
            issue allegedly subject to arbitration is severable, the stay of the court action
            or proceeding may be made with respect to the severable issue only. If a motion for
            an order to proceed with arbitration is made in the action or proceeding and is granted,
            the court order to proceed with arbitration shall include a stay of the action or
            proceeding.  § 7321.9.  Provisional remedies.  (a)  Court.--Before an arbitrator is appointed and is authorized and able to act, the court,
            upon motion of a party to an arbitration proceeding and for good cause shown, may
            enter an order for provisional remedies to protect the effectiveness of the arbitration
            proceeding to the same extent and under the same conditions as if the controversy
            were the subject of a civil action.  (b)  Arbitrator.--After an arbitrator is appointed and is authorized and able to act:  (1)  the arbitrator may issue orders for provisional remedies, including interim awards,
            as the arbitrator finds necessary to protect the effectiveness of the arbitration
            proceeding and to promote the fair and expeditious resolution of the controversy,
            to the same extent and under the same conditions as if the controversy were the subject
            of a civil action; and  (2)  a party to an arbitration proceeding may move the court for a provisional remedy only
            if the matter is urgent and the arbitrator is not able to act timely or the arbitrator
            cannot provide an adequate remedy.  (c)  Effect.--A party does not waive a right of arbitration by making a motion under subsection
            (a) or (b).  § 7321.10.  Initiation of arbitration.  (a)  Notice.--A person initiates an arbitration proceeding by giving notice in a record
            to the other parties to the agreement to arbitrate in the agreed manner between the
            parties or, in the absence of agreement, by certified or registered mail, return receipt
            requested and obtained, or by service as authorized for the commencement of a civil
            action. The notice must describe the nature of the controversy and the remedy sought.  (b)  Lack of notice.--Unless a person objects for lack or insufficiency of notice under
            section 7321.16 (relating to arbitration process) not later than at the beginning
            of the arbitration hearing, the person by appearing at the hearing waives any objection
            to lack of or insufficiency of notice.  § 7321.11.  Consolidation of separate arbitration proceedings.  (a)  Conditions.--Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), upon motion of a party
            to an agreement to arbitrate or to an arbitration proceeding, the court may order
            consolidation of separate arbitration proceedings as to all or some of the claims
            if:  (1)  there are separate agreements to arbitrate or separate arbitration proceedings between
            the same persons, or one of them is a party to a separate agreement to arbitrate or
            a separate arbitration proceeding with a third person;  (2)  the claims subject to the agreements to arbitrate arise in substantial part from the
            same transaction or series of related transactions;  (3)  the existence of a common issue of law or fact creates the possibility of conflicting
            decisions in the separate arbitration proceedings; and  (4)  prejudice resulting from a failure to consolidate is not outweighed by the risk of
            undue delay or prejudice to the rights of or hardship to parties opposing consolidation.  (b)  Partial consolidation.--The court may order consolidation of separate arbitration
            proceedings as to some claims and allow other claims to be resolved in separate arbitration
            proceedings.  (c)  Agreement governs.--The court may not order consolidation of the claims of a party
            to an agreement to arbitrate if the agreement prohibits consolidation.  § 7321.12.  Appointment of arbitrator; service as a neutral arbitrator.  (a)  Appointment.--If the parties to an agreement to arbitrate agree on a method for appointing
            an arbitrator, that method must be followed unless the method fails. If the parties
            have not agreed on a method, the agreed method fails or an arbitrator appointed fails
            or is unable to act and a successor has not been appointed, the court, on motion of
            a party to the arbitration proceeding, shall appoint the arbitrator. An arbitrator
            appointed by the court has all the powers of an arbitrator designated in the agreement
            to arbitrate or appointed under the agreed method.  (b)  Neutral service.--An individual may not serve as an arbitrator required by an agreement
            to be neutral under the standards under which a judge would be required to disqualify
            himself or herself from participation in a proceeding under 207 Pa. Code Ch. 33 Canon
            2 Rule 2.11 (relating to disqualification).  § 7321.13.  Disclosure by arbitrator.  (a)  Preappointment.--Before accepting appointment, an individual who is requested to serve
            as an arbitrator, after making a reasonable inquiry, shall disclose to all parties
            to the agreement to arbitrate and the arbitration proceeding and to any other arbitrators
            any known facts that a reasonable person would consider likely to affect the impartiality
            of the arbitrator in the arbitration proceeding, including:  (1)  a financial or personal interest in the outcome of the arbitration proceeding; and  (2)  an existing or past relationship with any of the parties to the agreement to arbitrate
            or the arbitration proceeding, their counsel or representatives, a witness or another
            arbitrator.  (b)  Continuing.--An arbitrator has a continuing obligation to disclose to all parties
            to the agreement to arbitrate and the arbitration proceeding and to other arbitrators
            facts that the arbitrator learns after accepting appointment that a reasonable person
            would consider likely to affect the impartiality of the arbitrator.  (c)  Objection.--If an arbitrator discloses a fact required by subsection (a) or (b) to
            be disclosed and a party timely objects to the appointment or continued service of
            the arbitrator based upon the fact disclosed, the objection may be a ground under
            section 7321.24(a)(2) (relating to vacating award) for vacating an award made by the
            arbitrator.  (d)  Nondisclosure.--If the arbitrator does not disclose a fact as required by subsection
            (a) or (b), upon timely objection by a party, the court under section 7321.24(a)(2)
            may vacate an award.  (e)  Presumption of neutrality.--An arbitrator appointed as a neutral arbitrator who does
            not disclose a known, direct and material interest in the outcome of the arbitration
            proceeding or a known, existing and substantial relationship with a party is presumed
            to act with evident partiality under section 7321.24(a)(2).  (f)  Procedure to challenge arbitrator.--If the parties to an arbitration proceeding agree
            to the procedures of an arbitration organization or other procedures for challenges
            to arbitrators before an award is made, substantial compliance with those procedures
            is a condition precedent to a motion to vacate an award on that ground under section
            7321.24(a)(2).  § 7321.14.  Action by majority.  If there is more than one arbitrator, the powers of an arbitrator must be exercised
            by a majority of the arbitrators but all of them shall conduct the hearing under section
            7321.16(c) (relating to arbitration process).  § 7321.15.  Immunity of arbitrator; competency to testify; attorney fees and costs.  (a)  Immunity.--An arbitrator or an arbitration organization acting in that capacity is
            immune from civil liability to the same extent as a judge of a court of this Commonwealth
            acting in a judicial capacity.  (b)  Other immunity.--The immunity afforded by this section supplements any immunity under
            other law.  (c)  Failure to disclose.--The failure of an arbitrator to make a disclosure required by
            section 7321.13 (relating to disclosure by arbitrator) does not cause a loss of immunity
            under this section.  (d)  Competency to testify.--In a judicial, administrative or similar proceeding, an arbitrator
            or representative of an arbitration organization is not competent to testify and may
            not be required to produce records as to any statement, conduct, decision or ruling
            occurring during the arbitration proceeding, to the same extent as a judge of a court
            of this Commonwealth acting in a judicial capacity. This subsection does not apply:  (1)  to the extent necessary to determine the claim of an arbitrator, arbitration organization
            or representative of the arbitration organization against a party to the arbitration
            proceeding; or  (2)  to a hearing on a motion to vacate an award under section 7321.24(a)(1) or (2) (relating
            to vacating award) if the movant establishes prima facie that a ground for vacating
            the award exists.  (e)  Attorney fees and costs.--If a person commences a civil action against an arbitrator,
            arbitration organization or representative of an arbitration organization arising
            from the services of the arbitrator, organization or representative, or if a person
            seeks to compel an arbitrator or a representative of an arbitration organization to
            testify or produce records in violation of subsection (d) and the court upon deciding
            whether the arbitrator, arbitration organization or representative of an arbitration
            organization is immune from civil liability or whether the arbitrator or representative
            of the organization is competent to testify, the court may award to the prevailing
            party, including the arbitrator, organization or representative, reasonable attorney
            fees and other reasonable expenses of litigation.  § 7321.16.  Arbitration process.  (a)  Discretion of arbitrator.--An arbitrator may conduct an arbitration in a manner appropriate
            for a fair and expeditious disposition of the proceeding. The authority conferred
            upon the arbitrator includes the power to hold conferences with the parties to the
            arbitration proceeding before the hearing and, among other matters, determine the
            admissibility, relevance, materiality and weight of any evidence.  (b)  Summary disposition.--An arbitrator may decide a request for summary disposition of
            a claim or particular issue:  (1)  if all interested parties agree; or  (2)  upon request of one party to the arbitration proceeding if that party gives notice
            to all other parties to the proceeding and if the other parties have a reasonable
            opportunity to respond.  (c)  Notice and hearing.--If an arbitrator orders a hearing, the arbitrator shall set a
            time and place and give notice of the hearing not less than five days before the hearing
            begins. Unless a party to the arbitration proceeding makes an objection to lack or
            insufficiency of notice not later than the beginning of the hearing, the party's appearance
            at the hearing waives the objection. Upon request of a party to the arbitration proceeding
            and for good cause shown, or upon the arbitrator's own initiative, the arbitrator
            may adjourn the hearing as necessary but may not postpone the hearing to a time later
            than that fixed by the agreement to arbitrate for making the award unless the parties
            to the arbitration proceeding consent to a later date. The arbitrator may hear and
            decide the controversy upon the evidence produced although a party who was notified
            of the arbitration proceeding did not appear. The court, on request, may direct the
            arbitrator to conduct the hearing promptly and render a timely decision.  (d)  Procedure.--At a hearing under subsection (c), a party to the arbitration proceeding
            has a right to be heard, to present evidence material to the controversy and to cross-examine
            witnesses appearing at the hearing.  (e)  Replacement.--If an arbitrator ceases or is unable to act during the arbitration proceeding,
            a replacement arbitrator must be appointed in accordance with section 7321.12 (relating
            to appointment of arbitrator; service as a neutral arbitrator) to continue the proceeding
            and to resolve the controversy.  (f)  Location for arbitration hearing for consumer transactions.--A hearing conducted under
            an arbitration agreement applicable to a consumer transaction shall be held at a location
            reasonably convenient to the consumer.  § 7321.17.  Representation by attorney.  A party to an arbitration proceeding may be represented by an attorney.  § 7321.18.  Witnesses; subpoenas; depositions; discovery.  (a)  Subpoenas.--An arbitrator may issue a subpoena for the attendance of a witness and
            for the production of records and other evidence at a hearing and may administer oaths.
            A subpoena must be served in the manner for service of subpoenas in a civil action
            and, upon motion to the court by a party to the arbitration proceeding or the arbitrator,
            may be enforced in the manner for enforcement of subpoenas in a civil action.  (b)  Depositions.--In order to make the proceedings fair, expeditious and cost effective,
            upon request of a party to or a witness in an arbitration proceeding, an arbitrator
            may permit a deposition of a witness to be taken for use as evidence at the hearing,
            including a witness who cannot be subpoenaed for or is unable to attend a hearing.
            The arbitrator shall determine the conditions under which the deposition is taken.  (c)  Discovery.--An arbitrator may permit discovery as the arbitrator decides is appropriate
            in the circumstances, taking into account the needs of the parties to the arbitration
            proceeding and other affected persons and the desirability of making the proceeding
            fair, expeditious and cost effective.  (d)  Compliance with discovery.--If an arbitrator permits discovery under subsection (c),
            the arbitrator may order a party to the arbitration proceeding to comply with the
            arbitrator's discovery-related orders, issue subpoenas for the attendance of a witness
            and for the production of records and other evidence at a discovery proceeding and
            take action against a noncomplying party to the extent a court could if the controversy
            were the subject of a civil action in this Commonwealth.  (e)  Protective orders.--An arbitrator may issue a protective order to prevent the disclosure
            of privileged information, confidential information, trade secrets and other information
            protected from disclosure to the extent a court could if the controversy were the
            subject of a civil action in this Commonwealth.  (f)  Compulsory laws.--All laws compelling a person under subpoena to testify and all fees
            for attending a judicial proceeding, a deposition or a discovery proceeding as a witness
            apply to an arbitration proceeding as if the controversy were the subject of a civil
            action in this Commonwealth.  (g)  Enforcement.--The court may enforce a subpoena or discovery-related order for the
            attendance of a witness within this Commonwealth and for the production of records
            and other evidence issued by an arbitrator in connection with an arbitration proceeding
            in another state upon conditions determined by the court so as to make the arbitration
            proceeding fair, expeditious and cost effective. A subpoena or discovery-related order
            issued by an arbitrator in another state must be served in the manner provided by
            law for service of subpoenas in a civil action in this Commonwealth and, upon motion
            to the court by a party to the arbitration proceeding or the arbitrator, may be enforced
            in the manner provided by law for enforcement of subpoenas in a civil action in this
            Commonwealth.  § 7321.19.  Judicial enforcement of preaward ruling by arbitrator.  If an arbitrator makes a preaward ruling in favor of a party to the arbitration proceeding,
            the party may request the arbitrator to incorporate the ruling into an award under
            section 7321.20 (relating to award). A prevailing party may make a motion to the court
            for an expedited order to confirm the award under section 7321.23 (relating to confirmation
            of award), in which case the court shall summarily decide the motion. The court shall
            issue an order to confirm the award unless the court vacates, modifies or corrects
            the award under section 7321.24 (relating to vacating award) or 7321.25 (relating
            to modification or correction of award).  § 7321.20.  Award.  (a)  Record.--An arbitrator shall make a record of an award. The record must be signed
            or otherwise authenticated by an arbitrator who concurs with the award. The arbitrator
            or the arbitration organization shall give notice of the award, including a copy of
            the award, to each party to the arbitration proceeding.  (b)  Time.--An award must be made within the time specified by the agreement to arbitrate
            or, if not specified in the agreement, within the time ordered by the court. The court
            may extend or the parties to the arbitration proceeding may agree in a record to extend
            the time. The court or the parties may do so within or after the time specified or
            ordered. A party waives an objection that an award was not timely made unless the
            party gives notice of the objection to the arbitrator before receiving notice of the
            award.  § 7321.21.  Change of award by arbitrator.  (a)  Motion.--On motion to an arbitrator by a party to an arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator
            may modify or correct an award:  (1)  upon a ground stated in section 7321.25(a)(1) or (3) (relating to modification or
            correction of award);  (2)  because the arbitrator has not made a final and definite award upon a claim submitted
            by the parties to the arbitration proceeding; or  (3)  to clarify the award.  (b)  Time for motion.--A motion under subsection (a) must be made and notice given to all
            parties within 20 days after the movant receives notice of the award.  (c)  Time for objection to motion.--A party to the arbitration proceeding must give notice
            of an objection to the motion within 10 days after receipt of the notice.  (d)  Pending motion to court.--If a motion to the court is pending under section 7321.23
            (relating to confirmation of award), 7321.24 (relating to vacating award) or 7321.25,
            the court may submit the claim to the arbitrator to consider whether to modify or
            correct the award:  (1)  upon a ground stated in section 7321.25(a)(1) or (3);  (2)  because the arbitrator has not made a final and definite award upon a claim submitted
            by the parties to the arbitration proceeding; or  (3)  to clarify the award.  (e)  Other provisions applicable.--An award modified or corrected under this section is
            subject to sections 7321.20(a) (relating to award), 7321.23, 7321.24 and 7321.25.  § 7321.22.  Remedies; fees and expenses of arbitration proceeding.  (a)  Punitive damages.--An arbitrator may award punitive damages or other exemplary relief
            if such an award is authorized by law in a civil action involving the same claim and
            the evidence produced at the hearing justifies the award under the legal standards
            otherwise applicable to the claim.  (b)  Attorney fees and costs.--An arbitrator may award reasonable attorney fees and other
            reasonable expenses of arbitration if the award is authorized by law in a civil action
            involving the same claim, by the agreement of the parties to the arbitration proceeding
            or by the terms of an agreement subject to arbitration.  (c)  Additional remedies.--As to all remedies other than those authorized by subsections
            (a) and (b), an arbitrator may order remedies as the arbitrator considers just and
            appropriate under the circumstances of the arbitration proceeding. The fact that a
            remedy could not or would not be granted by the court is not a ground for refusing
            to confirm an award under section 7321.23 (relating to confirmation of award) or for
            vacating an award under section 7321.24 (relating to vacating award).  (d)  Arbitrator costs and fees.--An arbitrator's expenses and fees, together with other
            expenses, must be paid as provided in the award.  (e)  Justification for punitive damages.--If an arbitrator awards punitive damages or other
            exemplary relief under subsection (a), the arbitrator shall specify in the award the
            basis in fact justifying and the basis in law authorizing the award and state separately
            the amount of the punitive damages or other exemplary relief.  § 7321.23.  Confirmation of award.  After a party to an arbitration proceeding receives notice of an award, the party
            must make a motion to the court for an order confirming the award. The court shall
            then issue a confirming order unless the award is modified or corrected under section
            7321.21 (relating to change of award by arbitrator) or 7321.25 (relating to modification
            or correction of award) or is vacated under section 7321.24 (relating to vacating
            award).  § 7321.24.  Vacating award.  (a)  Grounds.--Upon motion to the court by a party to an arbitration proceeding, the court
            shall vacate an award made in the arbitration proceeding if:  (1)  the award was procured by corruption, fraud or other undue means;  (2)  there was:  (i)  evident partiality by an arbitrator appointed as a neutral arbitrator;  (ii)  corruption by an arbitrator; or  (iii)  misconduct by an arbitrator prejudicing the rights of a party to the arbitration proceeding;  (3)  an arbitrator refused to postpone the hearing upon showing of sufficient cause for
            postponement, refused to consider evidence material to the controversy or otherwise
            conducted the hearing contrary to section 7321.16 (relating to arbitration process),
            so as to prejudice the rights of a party to the arbitration proceeding;  (4)  an arbitrator exceeded the arbitrator's powers;  (5)  there was no agreement to arbitrate, unless the person participated in the arbitration
            proceeding without raising the objection under section 7321.16(c) not later than the
            beginning of the arbitration hearing; or  (6)  the arbitration was conducted without proper notice of the initiation of an arbitration
            as required in section 7321.10 (relating to initiation of arbitration) so as to prejudice
            substantially the rights of a party to the arbitration proceeding.  (b)  Time.--A motion under this section must be filed within 30 days after the movant receives
            notice of the award under section 7321.20 (relating to award) or within 30 days after
            the movant receives notice of a modified or corrected award under section 7321.21
            (relating to change of award by arbitrator), unless the movant alleges that the award
            was procured by corruption, fraud or other undue means, in which case the motion must
            be made within 30 days after the ground is known or by the exercise of reasonable
            care would have been known by the movant.  (c)  Rehearing.--If the court vacates an award on a ground other than that set forth in
            subsection (a)(5), it may order a rehearing. If the award is vacated on a ground stated
            in subsection (a)(1) or (2), the rehearing shall be before a new arbitrator. If the
            award is vacated on a ground stated in subsection (a)(3), (4) or (6), the rehearing
            may be before the arbitrator who made the award or the arbitrator's successor. The
            arbitrator shall render the decision in the rehearing within the same time as that
            provided in section 7321.20(b) for an award.  (d)  Confirmation.--If the court denies a motion to vacate an award, the court shall confirm
            the award unless a motion to modify or correct the award is pending.  § 7321.25.  Modification or correction of award.  (a)  Grounds.--Upon motion made within 90 days after the movant receives notice of the
            award under section 7321.20 (relating to award) or within 90 days after the movant
            receives notice of a modified or corrected award under section 7321.21 (relating to
            change of award by arbitrator), the court shall modify or correct the award if:  (1)  there was an evident mathematical miscalculation or an evident mistake in the description
            of a person, thing or property referred to in the award;  (2)  the arbitrator has made an award on a claim not submitted to the arbitrator and the
            award may be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision upon the claims
            submitted; or  (3)  the award is imperfect in a matter of form not affecting the merits of the decision
            on the claims submitted.  (b)  Court action.--If a motion made under subsection (a) is granted, the court shall modify
            or correct and confirm the award as modified or corrected. Otherwise, unless a motion
            to vacate is pending, the court shall confirm the award.  (c)  Joinder.--A motion to modify or correct an award under this section may be joined
            with a motion to vacate the award under section 7321.24 (relating to vacating award).  § 7321.26.  Judgment on award; attorney fees and litigation expenses.  (a)  Judgment.--Upon granting an order confirming, vacating without directing a rehearing,
            modifying or correcting an award, the court shall enter a judgment in conformity with
            the order. The judgment may be recorded, docketed and enforced as any other judgment
            in a civil action.  (b)  Court costs.--A court may allow reasonable costs of the motion and subsequent judicial
            proceedings.  (c)  Attorney fees and costs.--On application of a prevailing party to a contested judicial
            proceeding under section 7321.23 (relating to confirmation of award), 7321.24 (relating
            to vacating award) or 7321.25 (relating to modification or correction of award), the
            court may add reasonable attorney fees and other reasonable expenses of litigation
            incurred in a judicial proceeding after the award is made to a judgment confirming,
            vacating without directing a rehearing, modifying or correcting an award if attorney
            fees and other expenses are authorized by law to be added to an award in a civil action
            involving the same claim as the arbitration award.  § 7321.27.  Jurisdiction.  (a)  Enforcement.--A court having jurisdiction over the controversy and the parties may
            enforce an agreement to arbitrate.  (b)  Exclusivity.--An agreement to arbitrate providing for arbitration in this Commonwealth
            confers exclusive jurisdiction on the court to enter judgment on an award under this
            subchapter.  § 7321.28.  Venue.  A motion under section 7321.6 (relating to application for judicial relief) must be
            made in the court of the county in which the agreement to arbitrate or section 7321.16(f)
            (relating to arbitration process) specifies the arbitration hearing is to be held
            or, if the hearing has been held, in the court of the county in which the hearing
            was held. Otherwise, the motion may be made in the court of the county in this Commonwealth
            as provided by the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure. All subsequent motions must
            be made in the court hearing the initial motion unless the court otherwise directs.  § 7321.29.  Appeals.  (a)  Appealable orders.--An appeal may be taken from:  (1)  an order denying a motion to compel arbitration;  (2)  an order granting a motion to stay arbitration;  (3)  an order confirming or denying confirmation of an award;  (4)  an order modifying or correcting an award;  (5)  an order vacating an award without directing a rehearing; or  (6)  a final judgment entered under this subchapter.  (b)  Procedure.--An appeal under this section must be taken as from an order or a judgment
            in a civil action and must be taken within 30 days of the order or judgment.  § 7321.30.  Uniformity of application and construction.  (a)  General rule.--In applying and construing this subchapter, consideration shall be
            given to the need to promote uniformity of the law with respect to the subject matter
            among states that enact it.  (b)  Right to trial by jury.--Except as provided by an agreement to arbitrate, nothing
            in this subchapter is intended to require a party to waive the right to trial by jury
            to the extent provided by the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution
            of Pennsylvania.  (c)  Severability.--If any provision of this subchapter or the application thereof to any
            person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of this subchapter and the application
            of such provisions to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected.  § 7321.31.  Relationship to Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act.  The provisions of this subchapter governing the legal effect,  validity and enforceability of electronic records or electronic  signatures and of contracts performed with the use of such  records or signatures conform to the requirements of section 102  of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act  (Public Law 106-229, 15 U.S.C. § 7002 ).  20180055u2s  Section 2.  Sections 7341 and 7342 of Title 42 are amended to read:  § 7341.  Common law arbitration.

            may not be vacated or modified unless it is clearly shown that a party was denied
            a hearing or that fraud, misconduct, corruption or other irregularity caused the rendition
            of an unjust, inequitable or unconscionable award.  § 7342.  Procedure.  (a)  General rule.--The following provisions of Subchapter [A] A.1 (relating to revised statutory arbitration) shall be applicable to arbitration conducted pursuant to this

(2)  Resolution of a part of the collaborative matter and agreement by all parties that

(b)  Termination.--A collaborative law process shall be terminated when:  (1)  A party gives written notice to all parties that the collaborative law process is
            terminated.  (2)  A party begins or resumes a pending proceeding before a tribunal related to a collaborative
            matter without the agreement of all parties.  (3)  Except as provided in subsection (c), a party discharges the party's attorney or the

            related to the collaborative matter.  (2)  Requesting the approval of a settlement agreement by a tribunal shall be considered
            part of the collaborative law process and not a related proceeding.  (b)  Exception.--Disqualification under subsection (a) shall not operate to prevent a collaborative

            or welfare of a party or a family member.  § 7408.  Disclosure of information.  During the collaborative law process, parties shall provide timely, full, candid and
            informal disclosure of information related to the collaborative matter without formal
            discovery, and shall update promptly previously disclosed information that has materially
            changed.  § 7409.  Confidentiality.  A collaborative law communication shall be confidential to the extent provided by
            the laws of this Commonwealth or as specified in the collaborative law participation
            agreement.  § 7410.  Privilege.  (a)  General rule.--Except as otherwise provided in this section, a collaborative communication
            is privileged, may not be compelled through discovery and shall not be admissible
            as evidence in an action or proceeding. Evidence that is otherwise admissible and
            subject to discovery shall not become inadmissible or protected from discovery solely
            because of its disclosure or use in a collaborative law process.  (b)  Waiver.--  (1)  A party may waive a privilege belonging to the party only if all parties waive the
            privilege and, in the case of a communication by a nonparty participant, only if the
            nonparty participant and all parties waive the privilege.  (2)  If a party discloses a privileged collaborative communication that prejudices another
            party, the disclosing party waives the right to assert a privilege under this section
            to the extent necessary for the party prejudiced to respond to the disclosure or representation.  (c)  Nonapplicability.--Privilege under subsection (a) shall not apply to:  (1)  A communication that is not subject to the privilege by agreement of the parties according
            to the terms of a participation agreement.  (2)  A communication that is made during a session of a collaborative law process that
            is open, or required by law to be open, to the public.  (3)  A communication sought, obtained or used to:  (i)  threaten or plan to inflict bodily injury, commit or attempt to commit a crime; or  (ii)  conceal ongoing criminal activity.  (d)  Exceptions.--The following exceptions apply to the privilege under subsection (a):  (1)  A communication sought or offered to prove or disprove facts relating to a claim or
            complaint of professional misconduct or malpractice or a fee dispute.  (2)  A communication sought or offered to prove facts relating to the abuse, neglect, abandonment
            or exploitation of a child or abuse of an adult.  (3)  A communication sought or offered in a criminal proceeding or in an action to enforce,
            void, set aside or modify a settlement agreement where a tribunal or court of competent
            jurisdiction finds that the evidence is not otherwise available and the need for the
            evidence substantially outweighs the interest in protecting the privilege.  (e)  Limitation.--  (1)  If a collaborative communication is subject to an exception under subsection (d),
            only the part of the collaborative communication necessary for the application of
            the exception may be disclosed or admitted.  (2)  Disclosure or admission of evidence under subsection (d) does not make the evidence
            or any other collaborative communication discoverable or admissible for any other
            purpose.  (f)  Construction.--This section shall not be construed to affect the scope of another
            applicable privilege under State law or rule of court.  § 7411.  Professional responsibility.  This chapter shall not affect the professional responsibility obligations and standards

                  No. 56  Cl. 18    20180056ua  Session of 2018  No. 2018-56    HB 1419    AN ACT    Amending Titles 18 (Crimes and Offenses) and 42 (Judiciary and Judicial Procedure)
            of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes, in criminal history record information,
            further providing for general regulations and for order for limited access and providing
            for clean slate limited access, for exceptions, for order to vacate order for limited
            access, for effects of expunged records and records subject to limited access and
            for employer immunity from liability; and, in juvenile matters, further providing
            for inspection of court files and records and for law enforcement records.    The General Assembly finds and declares as follows:  (1)  Individuals with charges not leading to convictions may be inherently harmed by the
            maintenance of that record and have a constitutional presumption of innocence.  (2)  Individuals convicted of crimes in this Commonwealth should serve their sentences
            as ordered by the courts of this Commonwealth.  (3)  After less violent individuals convicted of crimes have served their sentences and
            remained crime free long enough to demonstrate rehabilitation, the individuals' access
            to employment, housing, education and other necessities of life should be fully restored.  (4)  Criminal justice agencies need access to all criminal history record information in
            order to effectively carry out the agencies' duties to protect the public.  (5)  The Commonwealth shall provide a clean slate remedy, as set forth under this act,
            to:  (i)  Create a strong incentive for avoidance of recidivism by offenders.  (ii)  Provide hope for the alleviation of the hardships of having a criminal record by offenders
            who are trying to rehabilitate themselves.  (iii)  Save the Commonwealth money that must be spent in the administration of criminal justice
            when offenders recidivate.  (iv)  Ensure appropriate access to criminal history information by criminal justice agencies.  (6)  The clean slate remedy should be implemented without cost to the former offender of
            filing a petition with a court.    The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania hereby enacts as follows:    20180056u1s  Section 1.  Sections 9121(b) introductory paragraph, (2) and (3), (b.1) and (b.2) and 9122.1 heading,

            arrest, indictment or other information leading to the arrest or indictment which
            is subject to a court order for limited access as provided for in section 9122.2 (relating
            to clean slate limited access).  (3)  A court or the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts may not disseminate to
            an individual, a noncriminal justice agency or an Internet website any information

            rates and distribution systems,  providing for alternative ratemaking for utilities.    The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania hereby enacts as follows:    20180058u1s  Section 1.  Title 66 of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes is amended by adding a section
            to read:  § 1330.  Alternative ratemaking for utilities.  (a)  Declaration of policy.--The General Assembly finds and declares as follows:  (1)  Innovations in utility operations and information technologies are creating new opportunities
            for all customers, and it is in the public interest for the commission to approve
            just and reasonable rates and rate mechanisms to facilitate customer access to these
            new opportunities while ensuring that utility infrastructure costs are reasonably
            allocated to and recovered from customers and market participants consistent with
            the use of the infrastructure.  (2)  It is the policy of the Commonwealth that utility ratemaking should encourage and
            sustain investment through appropriate cost-recovery mechanisms to enhance the safety,
            security, reliability or availability of utility infrastructure and be consistent
            with the efficient consumption of utility service.  (b)  Alternative rate mechanisms.--  (1)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, including, but not limited to, sections
            2806.1(k)(2) (relating to energy efficiency and conservation program) and 2807(f)(4)
            (relating to duties of electric distribution companies), the commission may approve
            an application by a utility in a base rate proceeding to establish alternative rates
            and rate mechanisms, including, but not limited to, the following mechanisms:  (i)  decoupling mechanisms;  (ii)  performance-based rates;  (iii)  formula rates;  (iv)  multiyear rate plans; or  (v)  rates based on a combination of more than one of the mechanisms in subparagraphs (i),
            (ii), (iii) and (iv) or other ratemaking mechanisms as provided under this chapter.  (2)  An alternative rate mechanism established under this section may include rates under
            section 1307 (relating to sliding scale of rates; adjustments) or 1308 (relating to
            voluntary changes in rates) and may provide for recovery of returns on and return
            of capital investments or, in the case of city natural gas distribution operations,
            recovery under the cash flow ratemaking method.  (3)  Capital costs and expenses recovered through alternative rates and rate mechanisms

            Vehicles Act, is amended by adding definitions to read:  Section 2.  Definitions.  The following words and phrases when used in this act shall have the meanings given
            to them in this section unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:  * * *  ""Do-not-drive order.""  A notification provided to the owner of an affected vehicle by a manufacturer or by

            in attractive condition.  * * *  ""Stop-sale order.""  A notification issued by a manufacturer to its new vehicle dealers stating that certain
            used vehicles in inventory shall not be sold or leased, at retail or wholesale, due
            to a Federal safety recall for a defect or a noncompliance or a Federal or California
            emissions recall.  * * *  20180059u2s  Section 2.  The act is amended by adding a section to read:  Section 9.1.  Vehicle recalls.  (a)  General rule.--A manufacturer shall compensate its new vehicle dealers for all labor
            and parts required by the manufacturer to perform recall repairs. Compensation for
            recall repairs shall be in the same manner as warranty parts and labor compensation
            under section 9. If parts or a remedy are not reasonably available to perform a recall
            service or repair on a used vehicle held for sale by a new vehicle dealer of the same
            line-make within 30 days of the manufacturer issuing the initial notice of recall,
            and the manufacturer has issued a stop-sale order or a do-not-drive order on the vehicle,
            the manufacturer shall compensate the dealer at a prorated rate of at least 1.5% of
            the value of the vehicle per month, beginning on the date that is 30 days after the
            date on which the stop-sale order or do-not-drive order was provided to the dealer,
            until the earlier of the date the recall or remedy parts are made available or the
            date the dealer sells, trades or otherwise disposes of the affected used vehicle.
            The following shall apply:  (1)  The value of a used vehicle shall be the average trade-in value for used vehicles
            as indicated in an independent third-party guide for the year, make, model and mileage
            of the recalled vehicle at the time of the announcement of the stop-sale order or
            the do-not-drive order.  (2)  This section shall only apply to used vehicles subject to safety or emissions recalls
            pursuant to and recalled in accordance with Federal law and regulations and where
            a stop-sale order or a do-not-drive order has been issued. Further, this section shall
            only apply to new vehicle dealers holding used vehicles for sale that are a line-make
            that the dealer is franchised to sell or on which the dealer is authorized to perform
            recall repairs:  (i)  in inventory at the time the stop-sale order or do-not-drive order was issued; or  (ii)  which were taken into the used vehicle inventory of the dealer as a lease return vehicle
            or consumer trade-in incident to the purchase of a new vehicle from the dealer after
            the stop-sale order or do-not-drive order was issued.  (3)  Nothing in this section shall require a manufacturer to provide total compensation
            to a dealer which would exceed the total average trade-in value of the affected used
            motor vehicle as originally determined under paragraph (1).  (b)  Violation.--It is a violation of this section for a manufacturer to reduce the amount
            of compensation otherwise owed to a new vehicle dealer because the new vehicle dealer
            has submitted a claim for reimbursement under this section or was otherwise compensated
            for a vehicle subject to a recall where a stop-sale order or a do-not-drive order
            has been issued. This subsection applies regardless of whether the reduction in the
            amount of compensation owed to a new vehicle dealer is through a chargeback, removal
            from an incentive program, reduction in amount owed under an incentive program or
            any other means.  (c)  Procedure.--A reimbursement claim made by new vehicle dealers under this section for
            recall remedies or repairs, or for compensation where no part or repair is reasonably
            available and the used vehicle is subject to a stop-sale order or a do-not-drive order,
            shall be subject to the same limitations and requirements as a warranty reimbursement
            claim made under section 9. A claim shall be either approved or disapproved within
            30 days after the claim is submitted to the manufacturer in the manner and on the
            forms the manufacturer reasonably prescribes. A claim shall be paid within 30 days
            of approval of the claim by the manufacturer. A claim not specifically disapproved
            in writing within 30 days after the manufacturer receives a submitted claim shall
            be deemed to be approved.  (d)  Alternative compensation.--As an alternative to the compensation provided for under
            subsection (a):  (1)  a manufacturer may compensate its new vehicle dealers under a national recall compensation
            program if the compensation under the program is equal to or greater than that provided
            under subsection (a); or  (2)  the manufacturer and dealer otherwise agree to equal or greater compensation than
            that provided under subsection (a).  (e)  Exclusive remedy.--Any compensation provided to a new vehicle dealer pursuant to this
            section is exclusive and may not be combined with any other Federal or State recall
            compensation remedy.  (f)  Disclosure.--  (1)  A new or used vehicle dealer shall disclose in writing to used vehicle retail purchasers
            at the time of sale the existence of any open, unremedied recalls. By providing to
            the used vehicle retail purchaser a report obtained from the publicly accessible Internet
            website safercar.gov, or a successor website, based on a vehicle identification number
            search, the dealer shall be deemed to have complied with the disclosure requirement
            under this subsection. For the purpose of this subsection, failure to provide disclosures
            to multiple vehicle retail purchasers at the time of sale in violation of this subsection
            constitutes a single offense with a maximum fine of $1,000 under section 28(a).  (2)  Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit any civil actions or remedies
            available in statute or common law.  20180059u3s  Section 3.  Section 12(a)(8) of the act is amended to read:  Section 12.  Unlawful acts by manufacturers or distributors.  (a)  Unlawful coercive acts.--It shall be a violation for any manufacturer, factory branch,
            distributor, field representative, officer, agent or any representative whatsoever
            of such manufacturer, factory branch or distributor licensed under this act to require,
            attempt to require, coerce or attempt to coerce any new vehicle dealer in this Commonwealth
            to:  * * *  (8)  Expand, construct or significantly modify facilities before a date that is ten years after the date of the  construction of the facility or the alteration or remodeling  at that location was completed and without assurances that the manufacturer or distributor will provide a reasonable
            supply of new vehicles within a reasonable time so as to justify such an expansion
            in light of the market and economic conditions. This paragraph shall not apply if the expansion,  construction or significant modification is necessary to  comply with a health or safety law or to comply with a  technology requirement, which is necessary to sell or service  a vehicle that the new vehicle dealer is licensed by the  manufacturer to sell or service. This section shall apply to  any successor dealer provided the dealer has been designated  and approved by the manufacturer in the franchise agreement  and the construction, alteration or remodeling substantially  complied with the manufacturer's brand image standards or  plans that the manufacturer provided at the time the  construction, alteration or remodeling was completed. Nothing  in this paragraph shall prohibit a manufacturer from:  (i)  Continuing a facility improvement program that is in effect as of the effective date
            of this subparagraph with more than one new vehicle dealer in this Commonwealth or
            to renewing or modifying the facility improvement program.  (ii)  Providing lump sum or regularly scheduled payments to assist a new vehicle dealer
            in making a facility improvement, including construction, alteration or remodeling
            or installing signage or an image element.  (iii)  Providing reimbursement to a new vehicle dealer on reasonable, written terms for a
            portion of the new vehicle dealer's cost of making a facility improvement, including
            construction, alteration or remodeling, the purchase of goods, building materials
            or services or installing signage or an image element.  * * *  20180059u4s  Section 4.  Section 22(a)(9) of the act is amended and the section is amended by adding a subsection
            to read:  Section 22.  Application for license.  (a)  Dealer's or vehicle auction's license.--Application for license as a dealer or vehicle
            auction shall be made in writing to the board, signed by the applicant, setting forth
            the following:  * * *  (9)  A statement by the applicant that he has met all facility requirements as noted herein
            and as required by regulation , except as provided in subsection (a.1) .  (a.1)  Temporary permit for new vehicle dealers.--Upon receipt of a complete and accurate
               new vehicle dealer application or new vehicle dealer change of address application,
               the board shall issue a new vehicle dealer license immediately. If the new vehicle
               dealer does not have the franchise approval letter, the telephone business line information, the certificate of occupancy
               or the lease or deed for the property available when the application has been submitted,
               the new vehicle dealer shall receive a temporary permit that expires at the end of
               45 days from the date of closing. The new vehicle dealer shall submit the franchise
               approval letter, the telephone business line information, the certificate of occupancy
               and the lease or deed for the property prior to the expiration of the temporary permit.
               Upon receipt of the franchise approval letter, the telephone business line information,
               the certificate of occupancy and the lease or deed for the property, the board shall
               issue a new vehicle dealer license immediately.  * * *  20180059u5s  Section 5.  Section 27.1 heading and (a)(2) of the act is amended to read:  Section 27.1 . Licensing cost.  (a)  Licensing cost.--Subject to the limitations established under subsection (c), a licensed

            consideration for promotion or appointment may not be considered among the names from
            which a promotion or appointment is to be made.  § 2402.  Selection and appointment of eligibles.  (a)  Alternative selection procedure.--Unless a labor agreement contains promotion procedures
            which are inconsistent with this chapter, in which case the terms of the labor agreement
            shall be controlling, if a vacant position is to be filled, an appointing authority
            may:  (1)  request that the Office of Administration issue an appropriate certification of previously
            tested and active eligibles; or  (2)  request that the Office of Administration create and issue a certification of eligibles
            consisting only of the names of those candidates who responded by applying for the
            vacancy after receipt of notice of the vacancy from the Office of Administration.
            The failure of a candidate to apply for the vacancy shall be considered a waiver under
            section 2401 (relating to certification).  (b)  Selection of certified eligibles.--The following apply:  (1)  The certification of eligibles created and issued under this section shall be valid
            for 90 business days.  (2)  If the vacant position is to be filled from an eligible list, the appointing authority
            shall select an individual who is among the three highest-ranking available individuals
            on the certification of eligibles, unless the Office of Administration has specified
            prior to testing the eligibles on the eligible list that either all available individuals
            regardless of ranking or a specified alternative number other than three of the highest-ranking
            available individuals shall be used in making selections for the classification.  (3)  In making the second or subsequent selection from the eligibles on an employment or
            promotional certification, each selection shall be from among the similarly ranked
            available individuals remaining on the certification of eligibles.  (4)  After an individual has been rejected three times by an appointing authority in favor
            of others on the same eligible list, the individual may not be certified to that appointing
            authority, except upon written request from the appointing authority.  (5)  Appointing authorities shall promptly report to the Office of Administration the appointment
            of eligibles who have been certified.  (6)  If a certified eligible refuses to accept an offer of employment, the refusal shall
            be promptly investigated by the Office of Administration and, if found that the refusal
            has been made for improper or insufficient reasons, the Office of Administration shall,
            after giving 10 days' notice to the individual, remove the eligible from the eligible
            list.  § 2403.  Substitution during military leave.  (a)  Substitution for military leave.--When an employee in the classified service is granted
            military leave, the position vacated shall be filled only by substitute appointment
            or promotion and the employee appointed or promoted shall vacate the position upon
            return of the employee from military leave. A substitute employee, when required to
            vacate a position upon the return of the regular employee, shall have the right to
            return to the substitute employee's previous civil service position and status.  (b)  Substitute lists.--The substitute appointment or promotion shall be made from lists
            certified by the Office of Administration under this chapter.  § 2404.  Probationary period.  (a)  Completion and duration.--  (1)  No appointment to a position in the classified service shall be deemed complete until
            after the expiration of a probationary period.  (2)  The probationary period for each class of positions shall be prescribed by the Office
            of Administration and, except for trainee classes, shall in no case be less than six
            months nor more than 18 months. The probationary period for a trainee class shall
            be combined with that of the class for which the trainee is being trained. The combined
            probationary period shall be the same as the training period and shall not exceed
            24 months.  (3)  The appointing authority may remove an employee during the probationary period if,
            in the opinion of the appointing authority, the probation indicates that the employee
            is unable or unwilling to perform the duties satisfactorily or that the employee's
            dependability does not merit continuance in the service. Upon removal, the appointing
            authority shall notify the employee in a manner prescribed by the Office of Administration.  (b)  Notification of permanent status.--If the employee's work has been satisfactory, the
            appointing authority shall notify the employee in writing prior to the completion
            of the probationary period that the employee shall attain regular status in the classified
            service upon completion of the probationary period.  (c)  Further appointment.--If an employee is removed from a position during or at the end
            of the probationary period and the Office of Administration determines that the employee
            is suitable for appointment to another position, the employee's name may be restored
            to the eligible list from which the name was certified.  § 2405.  Provisional appointments.  (a)  Accelerated examination program.--The Office of Administration may authorize an accelerated
            examination program for the position to be filled if:  (1)  there is a great and urgent public need to fill a vacancy in a position in the classified
            service;  (2)  the Office of Administration is unable to certify an eligible for the vacancy from
            an eligible list or arrange for a reassignment, transfer, promotion or other means
            of filling the vacancy with a qualified employee; and  (3)  there is no regular examination immediately available.  (b)  Elements of program.--The accelerated examination program shall include:  (1)  Abbreviated, localized advertising for the position to ensure open competition.  (2)  Rapid processing and evaluation of the qualifications of applicants, ranking the applicants
            as well qualified, qualified and not qualified.  (3)  Certification of applicants determined to be well qualified and qualified for the
            position.  (c)  Appointment.--The appointing authority shall appoint applicants determined to be well
            qualified. If insufficient well-qualified applicants are available, the appointment
            shall be made from the qualified group.  (d)  Test period.--The appointee shall serve a six-month working test period upon successful
            completion of which the appointee shall be granted probationary status. Failure to
            successfully complete the working test period shall result in termination.  (e)  Successive appointments prohibited.--Successive provisional appointments of the same
            individual may not be made to the same position or classification.  (f)  Rights of provisional status.--The acceptance of a provisional appointment shall not
            confer upon the appointee rights of promotion, reinstatement or reassignment to another
            classification while in provisional status.  § 2406.  Temporary appointments to extra positions.  If, from pressure of work, an extra position in the classified service must be established
            for a period of 12 months or less, the appointing authority shall request the Office
            of Administration to certify the name of a qualified individual from an appropriate
            eligible list or by other means authorized by this part. In the request, the appointing
            authority shall state the cause of the extra work, the probable length of employment
            and the duties that the appointee is to perform.  § 2407.  Emergency appointments.  (a)  Appointment during emergency period.--An appointing authority or a subordinate authorized
            by the appointing authority may, to prevent serious impairment of the public business
            when an emergency arises and time may not permit securing authorization from the Office
            of Administration for the appointment of a certified eligible, appoint a qualified
            individual during the emergency for a period not exceeding 30 days and, with the approval
            of the Office of Administration, extend the appointment for a further period not to
            exceed 30 days.  (b)  Parameters.--The following shall not be considered an emergency:  (1)  a vacancy of which the appointing authority had reasonable notice; or  (2)  employment conditions of which the appointing authority had previous knowledge.  (c)  Nomenclature.--Individuals appointed under subsection (a) shall be known as emergency
            employees.  (d)  Report to Office of Administration.--Appointing authorities shall immediately report
            to the Office of Administration all emergency appointments.  (e)  Nonrenewal.--Appointments made under subsection (a) may not be renewed.

            the basis of the employee's last regular service ratings. Within the quarter, the
            employee shall be furloughed in the order of seniority, unless a labor agreement covering
            the employees to be furloughed exists in which case the terms of the labor agreement
            regarding a furlough procedure shall be controlling.  (ii)  The appointing authority may limit the application of this subparagraph in any particular

            shall, upon expiration of the leave of absence, have the right of return to any of
            the following:  (1)  the class and civil service status from which leave was granted;  (2)  a class and civil service status that the employee previously held, if the class is
            contained in the current class plan of the agency; or  (3)  a class and civil service status in the same or lower grade, if the employee meets
            the minimum qualifications given in the classification plan of the agency.  (b)  No vacancy upon return.--If there is no vacancy to which the employee on leave can
            be returned, the employee shall retain priority of return to the class from which

            of the leave, and, during that time period, the employee shall have precedence for
            employment over employees furloughed from the same class.  § 2609.  Seniority.  (a)  General rule.--Seniority is established for the classified service, classification
            series and for each class, unless there is in existence a labor agreement covering
            the position in the classified service, in which case the definition of seniority
            in the labor agreement shall control.  (b)  Calculation of seniority.--  (1)  Seniority for the classified service begins with the date of first civil service employment
            in a civil service class and includes periods of subsequent employment in any civil
            service class, providing the employment has been on a continuous basis.  (2)  Seniority for a classification series begins with the date of first civil service
            employment in the class series and includes periods of employment in classes within
            the series during any period while employed on a continuous basis in the classified
            service.  (3)  Seniority in each class begins with the date of first civil service employment in
            that class and includes periods of subsequent employment in that class during any
            period while employed on a continuous basis in the classified service.  (c)  Consideration of furlough and leave of absence.--Periods of furlough and approved
            leave of absence without pay shall be deemed continuous employment for seniority purposes,
            except that the period of furlough or leave of absence without pay shall not be counted
            toward seniority.

            the vehicle shall be assessed as to the level of damage at the time of recovery by
            an insurer or licensed physical damage appraiser:  (1)  If the cost of repairs exceeds the replacement value of the vehicle, the theft-branded
            certificate of salvage shall serve as an ownership document. If the vehicle thereafter
            passes the reconstructed salvage vehicle inspection requirements under section 1165
            (relating to reconstructed vehicles), it shall receive a certificate of title branded
            reconstructed and recovered-theft vehicle.  (2)  If the cost of repairs is [less than] more than 50% of the replacement value of the vehicle and the owner elects to retain title to the vehicle , the owner shall apply for a certificate of title branded recovered-theft vehicle.

            physical damage appraiser must accompany an application under this paragraph. The
            damage appraisal report shall include the replacement value of the vehicle.  (3)  If an owner has received a certificate of salvage branded as a theft vehicle after
            a payment has been made and the stolen vehicle is located and thereafter passes an
            inspection by a licensed physical damage appraiser in which the damage does not rise
            to the level of paragraph (2), the owner may apply to the department for an unbranded
            title. A legible copy of the vehicle damage appraisal report completed by an insurer
            or licensed physical damage appraiser must accompany an application under this paragraph.
            The damage appraisal report shall include the replacement value of the vehicle.  (4)  An individual who has not been paid the replacement value for the vehicle and has
            not received a certificate of salvage may use the existing certificate of title without

            enforcement officials, if the information is requested solely in connection with a
            criminal law enforcement action and is reasonably described.  (2)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, information gathered and maintained under
            this section that is kept by the Commonwealth, its authorized agents or its employees,
            including recorded images, written records, reports or facsimiles, names and addresses,
            shall be for the exclusive purpose of discharging its duties under this section. The
            information shall not be deemed a public record under the act of February 14, 2008
            (P.L.6, No.3), known as the Right-to-Know Law. The information shall not be discoverable
            by court order or otherwise or be admissible as evidence in a proceeding except to
            determine liability under this section. The restrictions provided in this paragraph
            shall not preclude a court of competent jurisdiction from issuing an order directing
            that the information be provided to law enforcement officials, if the information

            Number), OF MY INTENT TO PETITION THIS COURT FOR TEMPORARY GUARDIANSHIP.  I UNDERSTAND THAT FILING THIS PETITION DOES NOT REVOKE THE PARENTAL RIGHTS OF THE
            MINOR'S PARENT(S) NOR DOES IT GRANT ME ANY PARENTAL RIGHTS.  I UNDERSTAND THAT MY RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES AS A TEMPORARY GUARDIAN TOWARD THE
            MINOR CHILD(REN) NAMED ABOVE WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE UPON THE COMPLETION OF A HEARING
            AND RENDERING OF A DECISION BY THE COURT.  I UNDERSTAND THAT FILING FEES AND OTHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PROCEEDINGS MAY
            BE WAIVED IF I DEMONSTRATE THE FEES AND OTHER COSTS WOULD CONSTITUTE A FINANCIAL BURDEN
            TO ME AND MY FAMILY.  I HEREBY SWEAR OR AFFIRM THAT THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN IS TRUE AND CORRECT
            TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE.  .........................     ...............................  (DATE)                         (SIGNATURE OF PETITIONER)  (c)  Notice.--  (1)  The court shall notify a person named in the designation within 10 days of the filing
            of the petition and of any hearing on the petition.  (2)  If a designation has not been executed, the petitioner shall notify the custodial
            parent or parents, noncustodial parent or adoptive parent within 10 days of the filing
            of the petition and of any hearing on the petition.  (3)  If the petition alleges that a noncustodial parent cannot be located, that parent
            shall be notified in accordance with the notice provisions of the Pennsylvania Rules
            of Civil Procedure in custody matters. No notice is necessary to a parent whose parental
            rights have previously been terminated or relinquished.  (d)  Jurisdiction.--For purposes of determining jurisdiction under this chapter, the provisions
            of Chapter 54 (relating to uniform child custody jurisdiction and enforcement) shall
            apply.  (e)  Presumptions.--In a proceeding for judicial appointment of a temporary guardian, a
            designation shall constitute a rebuttable presumption that the designated temporary
            guardian is capable of serving as coguardian or guardian. When the designator is the
            sole surviving parent and when the parental rights of any noncustodial parent have
            been terminated or relinquished or when all parties consent to the designation, there
            shall be a rebuttable presumption that entry of the approval order is in the best
            interest of the child. In any case, if the court finds entry of the approval order
            to be in the best interests of the child, the court shall enter an order approving
            the designation petition.  (f)  Approval without hearing.--Approval of the designation without a hearing is permitted
            when the designator is the sole surviving parent, when the parental rights of a noncustodial
            parent have been terminated or relinquished or when all parties consent to entry of
            the approval order.  (g)  Hearing.--If a hearing is required, it shall be conducted in accordance with the proceedings
            under Chapters 53 (relating to child custody) and 54.  (h)  Court appearance.--If a designation has not been executed and a petition for temporary
            guardianship has been filed with the court by a family member, the custodial parent
            and noncustodial parent or adoptive parent shall appear in court in order to consent
            to or oppose the designation. If notice has been given under subsection (c)(3) and
            a noncustodial parent does not appear in court, it is presumed that consent to the
            designation has been granted.  (i)  Costs.--A court may waive filing fees and other costs upon application when the petitioner
            demonstrates the fees and other costs would constitute a financial burden upon the
            petitioner and the petitioner's family. There shall be a presumption of a financial
            burden if the income from all sources of the petitioner is less than 300% of the poverty
            level set by the Federal Government.  § 5623.  Authority of temporary guardian.  (a)  Authority.--  (1)  The temporary guardian shall have the authority to act as coguardian or guardian upon
            a custodial parent entering into an alcohol or drug treatment facility or upon a court
            ordering the designation pursuant to hearing under subsection 5622(b) (relating to
            petition for approval of designation).  (2)  The commencement of the temporary guardian's authority to act as coguardian shall
            not itself divest the custodial parent of parental rights but shall confer upon the
            temporary guardian concurrent or shared custody of the child.  (3)  A coguardian shall assure frequent and continuing contact with and physical access
            to the child and shall further assure the involvement of the custodial parent, to
            the greatest extent possible, in the decision making on behalf of the child.  (4)  The commencement of a temporary guardian's authority under this subchapter shall not
            itself divest a parent or legal guardian of parental or guardianship rights.  (b)  Limitations on authority.--In addition to any other restrictions placed on a temporary
            guardian by the court, the temporary guardian may not:  (1)  remove the minor or permit the minor to be removed from the United States either permanently
            or temporarily without the consent of the custodial parent and the approval of the
            court; or  (2)  remove the minor from this Commonwealth absent a court order, which may only be issued
            after a hearing at which both parents and the minor shall have the right to be present.  § 5624.  Period of temporary guardianship.  (a)  Initial period.--Temporary guardianship under this subchapter shall be limited to
            not more than 90 days from entry of the order of temporary guardianship.  (b)  Extension of guardianship.--Upon approval by the court or by written agreement of
            the temporary guardian and the parent who has entered a rehabilitation facility, temporary
            guardianship shall be extended for periods of up to 90 additional days.  (c)  Total period.--The total period of guardianship under this section shall not exceed
            365 days.  § 5625.  Termination of temporary guardianship.  (a)  Conditions.--A court shall terminate a temporary guardianship if any of the following
            exists:  (1)  The custodial parent demonstrates the basis for the temporary guardianship no longer
            exists.  (2)  The custodial parent and temporary guardian agree upon termination.  (3)  The temporary guardian files a petition with the court seeking termination.  (4)  Subject to subsection (b), a noncustodial or adoptive parent files a petition with
            the court seeking termination of the guardianship.  (5)  The temporary guardian or an individual who resides with the temporary guardian commits
            an offense that results in the temporary guardian or an individual who resides with
            the temporary guardian being identified as a perpetrator as defined in section 6303
            (relating to definitions).  (b)  Mandatory considerations.--Before terminating an order for temporary guardianship
            under subsection (a)(4), the court shall consider if termination of the temporary
            guardianship is in the best interests of the minor if the individual's parental rights
            were previously terminated.  20180088u5s  Section 5.  Section 6340(a)(5.1) of Title 23 is amended to read:  § 6340.  Release of information in confidential reports.  (a)  General rule.--Reports specified in section 6339 (relating to confidentiality of reports)
            shall only be made available to:  * * *  (5.1)  A court of common pleas in connection with any matter involving custody of a child
            as set forth in sections 5328 (relating to factors to consider when awarding custody)
            and 5329.1 (relating to consideration of child abuse and involvement with protective
            services) or temporary  guardianship of a child under Chapter 56 (relating to standby  and temporary guardianship) .  * * *  20180088u6s  Section 6.  This act shall take effect in 60 days.    APPROVED--The 23rd day of October, A.D. 2018.    TOM WOLF   "

The following is an example of a document that combines a living will and health care
            power of attorney:  DURABLE HEALTH CARE POWER OF ATTORNEY  AND HEALTH CARE TREATMENT INSTRUCTIONS  (LIVING WILL)  PART I  INTRODUCTORY REMARKS ON  HEALTH CARE DECISION MAKING  You have the right to decide the type of health care you want.  Should you become unable to understand, make or communicate decisions about medical
            care, your wishes for medical treatment are most likely to be followed if you express
            those wishes in advance by:  (1)  naming a health care agent to decide treatment for you; and  (2)  giving health care treatment instructions to your health care agent or health care
            provider.  An advance health care directive is a written set of instructions expressing your
            wishes for medical treatment. [It]  NOTICE ABOUT ANATOMICAL DONATION  This document may also contain directions regarding whether you wish to donate an
            organ, tissue or eyes. Under Pennsylvania law, donating a part of the body for transplantation
            or research is a voluntary act. You do not have to donate an organ, tissue, eye or
            other part of the body. However, it is important that you make your wishes about anatomical
            donation known, just as it is important to make your choices about end-of-life care
            known.  Surgeons have made great strides in the field of organ donation and can now transplant
            hands, facial tissue and limbs. A hand, facial tissue and a limb are examples of what
            is known as a vascularized composite allograft. Under Pennsylvania law, explicit and
            specific consent to donate hands, facial tissue, limbs or other vascularized composite
            allografts must be given. You may use this document to make clear your wish to donate
            or not to donate hands, facial tissue or limbs.  Under Pennsylvania law, the organ donor designation on the driver's license authorizes
            the individual to donate what we traditionally think of as organs (heart, lung, liver,
            kidney) and tissue and does not authorize the individual to donate hands, facial tissue,
            limbs or other vascularized composite allografts.  Detailed information about anatomical donation, including the procedure used to recover
            organs, tissues and eyes, can be found on the Department of Transportation's Internet
            website. Information about the donation of hands, facial tissue and limbs can also
            be found on the Department of Transportation's Internet website.  You may wish to consult with your physician or your attorney to determine whether
            the procedure for making an anatomical donation is compatible with fulfilling your
            specific choices for end-of-life care. In addition, you may want to consult with clergy
            regarding whether you want to donate an organ, a hand, facial tissue or limb or other
            part of the body. It is important to understand that donating a hand, limb or facial
            tissue may have an impact on funeral arrangements and that an open casket may not
            be possible.  An advance health care directive may contain a health care power of attorney, where you name a person called a ""health
            care agent"" to decide treatment for you, and a living will, where you tell your health
            care agent and health care providers your choices regarding the initiation, continuation,
            withholding or withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment and other specific directions regarding end-of-life  care and your views regarding organ and tissue donation .  You may limit your health care agent's involvement in deciding your medical treatment
            so that your health care agent will speak for you only when you are unable to speak
            for yourself or you may give your health care agent the power to speak for you immediately.
            This combined form gives your health care agent the power to speak for you only when
            you are unable to speak for yourself. A living will cannot be followed unless your
            attending physician determines that you lack the ability to understand, make or communicate
            health care decisions for yourself and you are either permanently unconscious or you
            have an end-stage medical condition, which is a condition that will result in death
            despite the introduction or continuation of medical treatment. You, and not your health
            care agent, remain responsible for the cost of your medical care.  If you do not write down your wishes about your health care in advance, and if later
            you become unable to understand, make or communicate these decisions, those wishes
            may not be honored because they may remain unknown to others.  A health care provider who refuses to honor your wishes about health care must tell
            you of its refusal and help to transfer you to a health care provider who will honor
            your wishes.  You should give a copy of your advance health care directive (a living will, health
            care power of attorney or a document containing both) to your health care agent, your
            physicians, family members and others whom you expect would likely attend to your
            needs if you become unable to understand, make or communicate decisions about medical
            care. If your health care wishes change, tell your physician and write a new advance
            health care directive to replace your old one. If your wishes about donating an organ, tissue or eyes  change, tell your physician and write a new advance health  care directive to replace your old one. If you do not wish to  donate a hand, facial tissue or limb, it is important to make  that clear in your advance health care directive or health  care power of attorney, or both. It is important in selecting a health care agent that you choose a person you trust
            who is likely to be available in a medical situation where you cannot make decisions
            for yourself. You should inform that person that you have appointed him or her as
            your health care agent and discuss your beliefs and values with him or her so that
            your health care agent will understand your health care objectives[.] , including whether you want to limit or  withhold life-sustaining measures in the event that you  become permanently unconscious or have an end-stage medical  condition. You should also tell your health care agent  whether you want to donate organs, tissue, eyes or other  parts of the body and whether you want to make a donation of  your hands, facial tissue or limbs. It is important to  understand that if you decide to donate a hand, limb or  facial tissue it may impact funeral arrangements and that an  open casket may not be possible.  You may wish to consult with knowledgeable, trusted individuals such as family members,
            your physician or clergy when considering an expression of your values and health
            care wishes. You are free to create your own advance health care directive to convey
            your wishes regarding medical treatment. The following form is an example of an advance
            health care directive that combines a health care power of attorney with a living
            will.  NOTES ABOUT THE USE OF THIS FORM  If you decide to use this form or create your own advance health care directive, you
            should consult with your physician and your attorney to make sure that your wishes
            are clearly expressed and comply with the law.  If you decide to use this form but disagree with any of its statements, you may cross
            out those statements.  You may add comments to this form or use your own form to help your physician or health
            care agent decide your medical care.  This form is designed to give your health care agent broad powers to make health care
            decisions for you whenever you cannot make them for yourself. It is also designed
            to express a desire to limit or authorize care if you have an end-stage medical condition
            or are permanently unconscious. If you do not desire to give your health care agent
            broad powers, or you do not wish to limit your care if you have an end-stage medical
            condition or are permanently unconscious, you may wish to use a different form or
            create your own. YOU SHOULD ALSO USE A DIFFERENT FORM IF YOU WISH TO EXPRESS YOUR
            PREFERENCES IN MORE DETAIL THAN THIS FORM ALLOWS OR IF YOU WISH FOR YOUR HEALTH CARE
            AGENT TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK FOR YOU IMMEDIATELY. In these situations, it is particularly
            important that you consult with your attorney and physician to make sure that your
            wishes are clearly expressed[.] ,  including whether you want to limit or withhold life- sustaining measures in the event that you become permanently  unconscious or have an end-stage medical condition and  whether you wish to donate a part of the body for  transplantation or research. You should also clearly express  whether or not you wish to donate hands, facial tissue or  limbs.  This form allows you to tell your health care agent your goals if you have an end-stage
            medical condition or other extreme and irreversible medical condition, such as advanced
            Alzheimer's disease. Do you want medical care applied aggressively in these situations
            or would you consider such aggressive medical care burdensome and undesirable?  You may choose whether you want your health care agent to be bound by your instructions
            or whether you want your health care agent to be able to decide at the time what course
            of treatment the health care agent thinks most fully reflects your wishes and values.  If you are a woman and diagnosed as being pregnant at the time a health care decision
            would otherwise be made pursuant to this form, the laws of this Commonwealth prohibit
            implementation of that decision if it directs that life-sustaining treatment, including
            nutrition and hydration, be withheld or withdrawn from you, unless your attending
            physician and an obstetrician who have examined you certify in your medical record
            that the life-sustaining treatment:  (1)  will not maintain you in such a way as to permit the continuing development and live
            birth of the unborn child;  (2)  will be physically harmful to you; or  (3)  will cause pain to you that cannot be alleviated by medication.  A physician is not required to perform a pregnancy test on you unless the physician
            has reason to believe that you may be pregnant.  Pennsylvania law protects your health care agent and health care providers from any
            legal liability for following in good faith your wishes as expressed in the form or
            by your health care agent's direction. It does not otherwise change professional standards
            or excuse negligence in the way your wishes are carried out. If you have any questions
            about the law, consult an attorney for guidance.  This form and explanation is not intended to take the place of specific legal or medical
            advice for which you should rely upon your own attorney and physician.  PART II  DURABLE HEALTH CARE POWER OF ATTORNEY  I,........................, of.................... County, Pennsylvania, appoint the
            person named below to be my health care agent to make health and personal care decisions
            for me.  Effective immediately and continuously until my death or revocation by a writing signed
            by me or someone authorized to make health care treatment decisions for me, I authorize
            all health care providers or other covered entities to disclose to my health care
            agent, upon my agent's request, any information, oral or written, regarding my physical
            or mental health, including, but not limited to, medical and hospital records and
            what is otherwise private, privileged, protected or personal health information, such
            as health information as defined and described in the Health Insurance Portability
            and Accountability Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-191, 110 Stat. 1936), the regulations
            promulgated thereunder and any other State or local laws and rules. Information disclosed
            by a health care provider or other covered entity may be redisclosed and may no longer
            be subject to the privacy rules provided by 45 C.F.R. Pt. 164.  The remainder of this document will take effect when and only when I lack the ability
            to understand, make or communicate a choice regarding a health or personal care decision
            as verified by my attending physician. My health care agent may not delegate the authority
            to make decisions.  MY HEALTH CARE AGENT HAS ALL OF THE FOLLOWING POWERS SUBJECT TO THE HEALTH CARE TREATMENT
            INSTRUCTIONS THAT FOLLOW IN PART III (CROSS OUT ANY POWERS YOU DO NOT WANT TO GIVE
            YOUR HEALTH CARE AGENT):  1.  To authorize, withhold or withdraw medical care and surgical procedures.  2.  To authorize, withhold or withdraw nutrition (food) or hydration (water) medically
            supplied by tube through my nose, stomach, intestines, arteries or veins.  3.  To authorize my admission to or discharge from a medical, nursing, residential or
            similar facility and to make agreements for my care and health insurance for my care,
            including hospice and/or palliative care.  4.  To hire and fire medical, social service and other support personnel responsible for
            my care.  5.  To take any legal action necessary to do what I have directed.  6.  To request that a physician responsible for my care issue a do-not-resuscitate (DNR)
            order, including an out-of-hospital DNR order, and sign any required documents and
            consents.  7.  To authorize or refuse to authorize donation of what we traditionally think of as
            organs (for example, heart, lung, liver, kidney), tissue, eyes or other parts of the
            body.  8.  To authorize or refuse to authorize donation of hands, facial tissue, limbs or other
            vascularized composite allografts.  APPOINTMENT OF HEALTH CARE AGENT  I appoint the following health care agent:  Health Care Agent:...................................  (Name and relationship)  Address:.............................................  .....................................................  Telephone Number:  Home............. Work............  E-mail:..............................................  IF YOU DO NOT NAME A HEALTH CARE AGENT, HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WILL ASK YOUR FAMILY
            OR AN ADULT WHO KNOWS YOUR PREFERENCES AND VALUES FOR HELP IN DETERMINING YOUR WISHES
            FOR TREATMENT. NOTE THAT YOU MAY NOT APPOINT YOUR DOCTOR OR OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDER
            AS YOUR HEALTH CARE AGENT UNLESS RELATED TO YOU BY BLOOD, MARRIAGE OR ADOPTION.  If my health care agent is not readily available or if my health care agent is my
            spouse and an action for divorce is filed by either of us after the date of this document,
            I appoint the person or persons named below in the order named. (It is helpful, but
            not required, to name alternative health care agents.)  First Alternative Health Care Agent:.................  (Name and relationship)  Address:.............................................  .....................................................  Telephone Number:  Home............. Work............  E-mail:..............................................  Second Alternative Health Care Agent:................  (Name and relationship)  Address:.............................................  .....................................................  Telephone Number:  Home............. Work............  E-mail:..............................................  GUIDANCE FOR HEALTH CARE AGENT (OPTIONAL) GOALS  If I have an end-stage medical condition or other extreme irreversible medical condition,
            my goals in making medical decisions are as follows (insert your personal priorities
            such as comfort, care, preservation of mental function, etc.):...................................................  .........................................................  .........................................................  .........................................................  SEVERE BRAIN DAMAGE OR BRAIN DISEASE  If I should suffer from severe and irreversible brain damage or brain disease with
            no realistic hope of significant recovery, I would consider such a condition intolerable
            and the application of aggressive medical care to be burdensome. I therefore request
            that my health care agent respond to any intervening (other and separate) life-threatening
            conditions in the same manner as directed for an end-stage medical condition or state
            of permanent unconsciousness as I have indicated below.  Initials..............I agree  Initials..............I disagree  PART III  HEALTH CARE TREATMENT INSTRUCTIONS IN THE EVENT  OF END-STAGE MEDICAL CONDITION  OR PERMANENT UNCONSCIOUSNESS  (LIVING WILL)  The following health care treatment instructions exercise my right to make my own
            health care decisions. These instructions are intended to provide clear and convincing
            evidence of my wishes to be followed when I lack the capacity to understand, make
            or communicate my treatment decisions:  IF I HAVE AN END-STAGE MEDICAL CONDITION (WHICH WILL RESULT IN MY DEATH, DESPITE THE
            INTRODUCTION OR CONTINUATION OF MEDICAL TREATMENT) OR AM PERMANENTLY UNCONSCIOUS SUCH
            AS AN IRREVERSIBLE COMA OR AN IRREVERSIBLE VEGETATIVE STATE AND THERE IS NO REALISTIC
            HOPE OF SIGNIFICANT RECOVERY, ALL OF THE FOLLOWING APPLY (CROSS OUT ANY TREATMENT
            INSTRUCTIONS WITH WHICH YOU DO NOT AGREE):  1.  I direct that I be given health care treatment to relieve pain or provide comfort
            even if such treatment might shorten my life, suppress my appetite or my breathing,
            or be habit forming.  2.  I direct that all life prolonging procedures be withheld or withdrawn. You may want to consult with your physician and attorney in order to determine whether
               your designated choices regarding end-of-life care are compatible with anatomical
               donation. In order to donate an organ your body may need to be maintained on artificial
               support after you have been declared dead to facilitate anatomical donation. Detailed
               information about the procedure for being declared brain dead or dead by lack of cardiac
               function and information about organ donation can be found on the Department of Transportation's
               publicly accessible Internet website.  3.  I specifically do not want any of the following as life prolonging procedures: (If
            you wish to receive any of these treatments, write ""I do want"" after the treatment)  heart-lung resuscitation (CPR)....................  mechanical ventilator (breathing machine).........  dialysis (kidney machine).........................  surgery...........................................  chemotherapy......................................  radiation treatment...............................  antibiotics.......................................  Please indicate whether you want nutrition (food) or hydration (water) medically supplied
            by a tube into your nose, stomach, intestine, arteries, or veins if you have an end-stage
            medical condition or are permanently unconscious and there is no realistic hope of
            significant recovery. (Initial only one statement.)  TUBE FEEDINGS  ........I want tube feedings to be given  OR  NO TUBE FEEDINGS  ........I do not want tube feedings to be given.  4.  If I have authorized donation of an organ (such as a heart, liver or lung) or a vascularized
            composite allograft in the next section of this document, I authorize the use of artificial
            support, including a ventilator, for a limited period of time after I am declared
            dead to facilitate the donation.  5.  I specifically do not want to be on artificial support after I am declared dead.......................  HEALTH CARE AGENT'S USE OF INSTRUCTIONS  (INITIAL ONE OPTION ONLY).  ........My health care agent must follow these instructions.  OR  ........These instructions are only guidance.  My health care agent shall have final say and may override any of my instructions.
            (Indicate any exceptions)...................................  ..............................................  If I did not appoint a health care agent, these instructions shall be followed.  LEGAL PROTECTION  Pennsylvania law protects my health care agent and health care providers from any
            legal liability for their good faith actions in following my wishes as expressed in
            this form or in complying with my health care agent's direction. On behalf of myself,
            my executors and heirs, I further hold my health care agent and my health care providers
            harmless and indemnify them against any claim for their good faith actions in recognizing
            my health care agent's authority or in following my treatment instructions.  [ORGAN DONATION (INITIAL ONE OPTION ONLY.)     ........              I consent to donate my organs and tissues at the time of my death for the purpose
                     of transplant, medical study or education. (Insert any limitations you desire on donation
                     of specific organs or tissues or uses for donation of organs and tissues.)      OR          ........      I do not consent to donate my organs or tissues at the time of my death.]     SIGNATURE..................................................  INFORMATION ABOUT ANATOMICAL DONATION  Donating an organ or other part of the body is a voluntary act. Under Pennsylvania
            law, you do not have to donate an organ or any other part of your body. It is important
            to know the effect of organ donation on your decisions about end-of-life care so that
            your wishes about end-of-life care will be fulfilled. If someone wishes to become
            an organ donor, the person may be kept on artificial support after the person has
            been declared dead to facilitate anatomical donation. Detailed information about the
            procedure for recovering organs and other parts of the body and detailed information
            about brain death and cardiac death may be found on the Department of Transportation's
            publicly accessible Internet website.  Under Pennsylvania law, the organ donor designation on the driver's license authorizes
            the individual to donate what we traditionally think of as organs (for example, heart,
            lung, liver, kidney) and tissue and does not authorize the individual to donate hands,
            facial tissue, limbs or other vascularized composite allografts.  Under Pennsylvania law, explicit and specific consent to donate hands, facial tissue,
            limbs and other vascularized composite allografts is needed. Donation of these parts
            of the body is voluntary. Information about the procedure to transplant hands, facial
            tissue and limbs can be found on the Department of Transportation's publicly accessible
            Internet website. It is important to know that donating a hand, limb or facial tissue
            may impact funeral arrangements and that an open casket may not be possible.  ORGAN DONATION  ........I consent to making an anatomical gift. This gift does not include hands,
            facial tissue, limbs or other vascularized composite allografts. I understand that
            if I want to donate a hand, facial tissue, limb or other vascularized composite allograft,
            there is another place in this document for me to do so. I also understand the hospital
            may provide artificial support, which may include a ventilator, after I am declared
            dead in order to facilitate donation. I consent to making a gift of the following
            parts of my body for transplantation or research (please insert any limitations you
            desire on donation of specific organs or tissues or eyes or any limitation on the
            use of a donated part of the body):  ...........................................................  ...........................................................  ...........................................................  SIGNATURE..........................DATE....................  GIFT OF HANDS, FACIAL TISSUE, LIMBS AND OTHER VASCULARIZED COMPOSITE ALLOGRAFTS  ........I consent to making a gift of my hands, facial tissue, limbs or other vascularized
            composite allografts. I also understand that I have the option of requesting reconstruction
            of my body in preparation for burial and that anonymity of identity may not be able

            disability, except to the extent that the physical or mental disability has been found
            by a physician or surgeon following an individualized evaluation of the individual
            to be medically significant to the provision of the anatomical gift. If an individual
            has the necessary support system to assist the individual in complying with posttransplant

            not participate in the procedures for removing or transplanting a part.]  (c)  Certain liability limited.--[A] The following shall  apply:  (1)  Subject to paragraph (2), a person who acts in good faith in accordance with the terms of this subchapter or
            with the anatomical gift laws of another state or a foreign country [is not] shall not be liable for damages in any civil action or subject to prosecution in any criminal

Ch. 91  (relating to criminal history record information), an organ  procurement organization is authorized to obtain a copy of an  autopsy report in a timely fashion upon request and payment of  reasonable copying fees.  § 8617.  Requests for anatomical gifts.  [(a)  Procedure.--On or before the occurrence of each death in an acute care general hospital,
            the hospital shall make contact with the regional organ procurement organization in
            order to determine the suitability for organ, tissue and eye donation for any purpose
            specified under this subchapter. This contact and the disposition shall be noted on
            the patient's medical record.  (b)  Limitation.--If the hospital administrator or his designee has received actual notice
            of opposition from any of the persons named in section 8611(b) (relating to persons
            who may execute anatomical gift) and the decedent was not in possession of a validly
            executed donor card, the gift of all or any part of the decedent's body shall not
            be requested.  (c)  Donor card.--Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the intent of a
            decedent to participate in an organ donor program as evidenced by the possession of
            a validly executed donor card, donor driver's license, living will, durable power
            of attorney or other document of gift shall not be revoked by any member of any of
            the classes specified in section 8611(b).  (d)  Identification of potential donors.--Each acute care general hospital shall develop
            within one year of the date of final enactment of this section, with the concurrence
            of the hospital medical staff, a protocol for identifying potential organ and tissue
            donors. It shall require that, at or near the time of every individual death, all
            acute care general hospitals contact by telephone their regional organ procurement
            organization to determine suitability for organ, tissue and eye donation of the individual
            in question. The person designated by the acute care general hospital to contact the
            organ procurement organization shall have the following information available prior
            to making the contact:  (1)  The patient's identifier number.  (2)  The patient's age.  (3)  The cause of death.  (4)  Any past medical history available.  The organ procurement organization, in consultation with the patient's attending physician
            or his designee, shall determine the suitability for donation. If the organ procurement
            organization in consultation with the patient's attending physician or his designee
            determines that donation is not appropriate based on established medical criteria,
            this shall be noted by hospital personnel on the patient's record, and no further
            action is necessary. If the organ procurement organization in consultation with the
            patient's attending physician or his designee determines that the patient is a suitable
            candidate for anatomical donation, the acute care general hospital shall initiate
            a request by informing the persons and following the procedure designated under section
            8611(b) of the option to donate organs, tissues or eyes. The person initiating the
            request shall be an organ procurement organization representative or a designated
            requestor. The organ procurement organization representative or designated requestor
            shall ask persons pursuant to section 8611(b) whether the deceased was an organ donor.
            If the person designated under section 8611(b) does not know, then this person shall
            be informed of the option to donate organs and tissues. The protocol shall encourage
            discretion and sensitivity to family circumstances in all discussions regarding donations
            of tissue or organs. The protocol shall take into account the deceased individual's
            religious beliefs or nonsuitability for organ and tissue donation.  (e)  Tissue procurement.--  (1)  The first priority use for all tissue shall be transplantation.  (2)  Upon Department of Health approval of guidelines pursuant to subsection (f)(1)(ii),
            all acute care general hospitals shall select at least one tissue procurement provider.
            A hospital shall notify the regional organ procurement organization of its choice
            of tissue procurement providers. If a hospital chooses more than one tissue procurement
            provider, it may specify a rotation of referrals by the organ procurement organization
            to the designated tissue procurement providers.  (3)  Until the Department of Health has approved guidelines pursuant to subsection (f)(1)(ii),
            tissue referrals at each hospital shall be rotated in a proportion equal to the average
            rate of donors recovered among the tissue procurement providers at that hospital during
            the two-year period ending August 31, 1994.  (4)  The regional organ procurement organization, with the assistance of tissue procurement
            providers, shall submit an annual report to the General Assembly on the following:  (i)  The number of tissue donors.  (ii)  The number of tissue procurements for transplantation.  (iii)  The number of tissue procurements recovered for research by each tissue procurement
            provider operating in this Commonwealth.]  (a)  Procedure.--A hospital located in this Commonwealth shall notify the applicable designated
            organ procurement organization or a third party designated by the organ procurement
            organization of an individual whose death is imminent or who has died in the hospital.
            Notification shall be made in a timely manner to ensure that examination, evaluation
            and ascertainment of donor status as specified in subsection (d) may be completed
            within a time frame compatible with the donation of organs and tissues for transplant.
            The notification shall be made without regard to whether the person has executed an
            advance health care directive.  (b)  Referrals.--If an organ procurement organization receives a referral of an individual
            whose death is imminent or who has died in a hospital, the organ procurement organization
            shall make a reasonable search of the records of the Donate Life PA Registry or the
            applicable State donor registry that the organ procurement organization knows exists
            for the geographic area in which the individual resided or resides in order to ascertain
            whether the individual has made an anatomical gift.  (c)  Document of gift.--  (1)  If the individual whose death is imminent or has died in the hospital has a document
            of gift which authorizes an anatomical donation, including registration with the Donate
            Life PA Registry, the organ procurement organization representative or the designated
            requestor shall attempt to notify a person listed in section 8611(b) (relating to
            persons who may execute anatomical gift) of the gift.  (2)  If no document of gift is known to the organ procurement organization representative
            or the designated requestor, then the organ procurement organization representative
            or the designated requestor shall ask the persons listed in section 8611(b) whether
            the individual had a validly executed document of gift. If there is no evidence of
            an anatomical gift by the individual, the organ procurement organization representative
            or the designated requestor shall notify a person listed in section 8611(b) of the
            option to donate organs and tissues. The notification shall be performed in accordance
            with a protocol that encourages discretion and sensitivity to family circumstances
            in all discussions regarding donations of organs and tissues. The protocol shall take
            into account the individual's religious beliefs or nonsuitability for organ and tissue
            donation.  (3)  The hospital administrator or the hospital administrator's designated representative
            shall indicate in the medical record of the individual the information under this
            paragraph. The information shall also be communicated by the hospital administrator
            or the hospital administrator's designee to the organ procurement organization or
            designated requestor, as appropriate:  (i)  whether or not a document of gift is known to exist and whether a gift was made;  (ii)  if a gift was made, the name of the person granting the gift and that person's relationship
            to the individual; and  (iii)  all of the following:  (A)  Whether the individual executed an advance health care directive, living will, power
            of attorney, health care power of attorney, will or other document, including a do-not-resuscitate
            (DNR) order, evidencing an intention to limit, withdraw or withhold life-sustaining
            measures.  (B)  Whether the individual indicated in an advance health care directive, living will,
            power of attorney, health care power of attorney, will or other document an intention
            to limit the anatomical gifts of the individual in any way, including the intention
            to limit an anatomical gift to parts of the body which do not require a ventilator
            or other life-sustaining measures, or to deny making or refusing to make an anatomical
            gift.  (C)  Whether the individual amended or revoked an anatomical gift in any document specified
            in this subparagraph or in any other document or in accordance with section 8615 (relating
            to amendment or revocation of gift).  (d)  Testing.--  (1)  This subsection shall apply if:  (i)  a hospital refers an individual whose death is imminent or who has died in a hospital
            to an organ procurement organization;  (ii)  the organ procurement organization, in consultation with the individual's attending
            physician or a designee, determines, based upon a medical record review and other
            information supplied by the individual's attending physician or a designee, that the
            individual may be a prospective donor; and  (iii)  the individual has not:  (A)  indicated in an advance health care directive, a living will, power of attorney, health
            care power of attorney, will, DNR order or other document an intention to either limit
            the anatomical gifts of the individual to parts of the body which do not require a
            ventilator or other life-sustaining measures or indicated an intention to deny making
            or refusing to make an anatomical gift; or  (B)  amended or revoked an anatomical gift in any document specified in subsection (c)(3)
            or in any other document or in accordance with section 8615.  (2)  If the requirements of paragraph (1) are met, the following shall apply:  (i)  Subject to the wishes expressed by the individual under subsection (c)(3), the organ
            procurement organization may conduct a blood or tissue test or minimally invasive
            examination which is reasonably necessary to evaluate the medical suitability of a
            part that is or may be the subject of an anatomical gift. Testing and examination
            under this subparagraph shall comply with a denial or refusal to make an anatomical
            gift or any limitation expressed by the individual with respect to the part of the
            body to donate or a limitation in the provision of a ventilator or other life-sustaining
            measures, as specified in subsection (c)(3) or a revocation or amendment to an anatomical
            gift as specified in a document in subsection (c)(3) or in any other document or in
            accordance with section 8615. The results of tests and examinations under this subparagraph
            shall be used or disclosed only:  (A)  to evaluate medical suitability for donation and to facilitate the donation process;
            and  (B)  as required or permitted by law.  (ii)  Subject to the wishes expressed by the individual under subsection (c)(3), the hospital
            may not withdraw any measures which are necessary to maintain the medical suitability
            of the part until the organ procurement organization or designated requestor, as appropriate,
            has had the opportunity to advise the applicable persons as set forth in section 8611(b)
            of the option to make an anatomical gift and has received or been denied authorization
            to proceed with recovery of the part.  (e)  Testing after death.--Subject to the individual's wishes under subsection (c)(3),
            after an individual's death, a person to whom an anatomical gift may pass under section
            8612 (relating to persons who may become donees; purposes for which anatomical gifts
            may be made) may conduct a test or examination which is reasonably necessary to evaluate
            the medical suitability of the body or part for its intended purpose.  (f)  Guidelines.--  (1)  The Department of Health, in consultation with organ procurement organizations, tissue
            procurement providers and the Hospital Association of Pennsylvania, donor recipients
            and family appointed pursuant to section 8622(c)(3) (relating to The Governor Robert
            P. Casey Memorial Organ and Tissue Donation Awareness Trust Fund) shall, within six
            months of the effective date of this [chapter] subchapter , do all of the following:  (i)  Establish guidelines regarding efficient procedures facilitating the delivery of anatomical
            gift donations from receiving hospitals to organ procurement organizations and tissue providers.  (ii)  Develop guidelines to assist hospitals in the selection and designation of tissue
            procurement providers.  (2)  Each organ procurement organization and each tissue procurement provider operating
            within this Commonwealth shall, within six months of the effective date of this chapter,
            file with the Department of Health, for public review, its operating protocols.  (f.1)  Scope.--The determination under this section may include copying of records necessary
            to determine the medical suitability of the body or part. This subsection includes
            medical, dental and other health-related records.  (f.2)  Recipients.--  (1)  Subject to the provisions of this subchapter, the rights of the person to whom a part
            passes under section 8612 shall be superior to the rights of all others with respect
            to the part. The person may accept or reject an anatomical gift in whole or in part.  (2)  Subject to the wishes of the individual under subsection (c)(3) and this subchapter,
            a person that accepts an anatomical gift of an entire body may allow embalming, burial
            or cremation and the use of remains in a funeral service. If the gift is of a part,
            the person to whom the part passes under section 8612, upon the death of the individual
            and before embalming, burial or cremation, shall cause the part to be removed without
            unnecessary mutilation.  (f.3)  Physicians.--  (1)  Neither the physician who attends the individual at death nor the physician who determines
            the time of the individual's death may participate in the procedures for removing
            or transplanting a part from the individual.  (2)  Subject to the individual's wishes under subsection (c)(3), and subject to paragraph
            (1), a physician or technician may remove a donated part from the body of an individual
            that the physician or technician is qualified to remove.  (f.4)  Coordination of procurement and use.--  (1)  A hospital shall enter into agreements or affiliations with organ procurement organizations
            for coordination of procurement and use of anatomical gifts.  (2)  The organ procurement organization, hospital personnel and other individuals involved
            in the anatomical donation process shall limit the testing and examination of the
            individual under this section so as to comply with the wishes of the individual under
            subsection (c)(3).  (g)  Death record review.--  (1)  The Department of Health shall make annual death record reviews at acute care general
            hospitals to determine their compliance with subsection [(d)] (a) .  (2)  To conduct a review of an acute care general hospital, the following apply:  (i)  The [Department of Health] department shall select to carry out the review the Commonwealth-licensed organ procurement
            organization designated by the [Health Care Financing Administration] Centers for Medicare and  Medicaid Services for the region within which the acute care general hospital is located. For an organ
            procurement organization to be selected under this subparagraph, the organization
            must not operate nor have an ownership interest in an entity which provides all of
            the functions of a tissue procurement provider.  (ii)  If there is no valid selection under subparagraph (i) or if the organization selected
            under subparagraph (i) is unwilling to carry out the review, the department shall
            select to carry out the review any other Commonwealth-licensed organ procurement organization.
            For an organ procurement organization to be selected under this subparagraph, the
            organization must not operate nor have an ownership interest in an entity which provides
            all of the functions of a tissue procurement provider.  (iii)  If there is no valid selection under subparagraph (ii) or if the organization selected
            under subparagraph (ii) is unwilling to carry out the review, the department shall
            carry out the review using trained department personnel.  (3)  There shall be no cost assessed against a hospital for a review under this subsection.  (4)  If the department finds, on the basis of a review under this subsection, that a hospital
            is not in compliance with subsection [(d)] (a) , the department may impose an administrative fine of up to $500 for each instance
            of noncompliance. A fine under this paragraph is subject to 2 Pa.C.S. Ch. 5 Subch.
            A (relating to practice and procedure of Commonwealth agencies) and Ch. 7 Subch. A
            (relating to judicial review of Commonwealth agency action). Fines collected under
            this paragraph shall be deposited into the fund.  (5)  An organ procurement organization may, upon request and payment of associated fees,
            obtain certified copies of death records of a donor from the Division of Vital Records
            of the department.  (h)  Definitions.--As used in this section, the following words and phrases shall have
            the meanings given to them in this subsection:  ""Designated requestor.""  A hospital employee completing a course offered by [an] a designated organ procurement organization on how to approach potential donor families and request
            organ or tissue donation.  ""Noncompliance.""  Any failure on the part of a hospital to contact an organ procurement organization
            as required under subsection [(d)] (a) .  § 8619.  Use of driver's license or identification card to indicate organ or tissue donation.  (a)  General rule.--The Department of Transportation shall redesign the driver's license
            and identification card application system to process requests for information regarding
            consent of the individual to organ or tissue donation. The following question shall
            be asked on both the application for a driver's license or identification card and
            on the organ donor designation at a photo center:  Pennsylvania strongly supports organ and tissue donation because of its life-saving
            and life-enhancing opportunities.  Do you wish to have the organ donor designation printed on your driver's license?  Only an affirmative response of an individual shall be noted on the front of the driver's
            license or identification card and shall clearly indicate the individual's intent
            to donate his organs or tissue. [A notation on an individual's driver's license or
            identification card that he intends to donate his organs or tissue is deemed sufficient
            to satisfy all requirements for consent to organ or tissue donation.] Nothing  in this section shall be construed to authorize a donation of a  hand, facial tissue, limb or other vascularized composite  allograft. The Department of Transportation shall record and  store all donor designations in the Donate Life PA Registry.  Subject to an individual's wishes as expressed in a document  listed under sections 8613(e)(2) (relating to manner of  executing anatomical gifts) and to the individual's wishes under  section 8617(c)(3) (relating to requests for anatomical gifts),  the recorded and stored designation is sufficient to satisfy all  requirements for consent to organ and tissue donation. The  recorded and stored designation is not a public record subject  to disclosure as defined in section 102 of the act of February  14, 2008 (P.L.6, No.3), known as the Right-to-Know Law.  (a.1)  Informational insert.--The following apply:  (1)  Within 180 days of the effective date of this subsection, the Department of Transportation
            shall furnish an informational insert about organ donation, tissue donation and donation
            of vascularized composite allografts to each holder of a driver's license or identification
            card when the department mails a camera card to the holder at the time of renewal.  (2)  The informational insert shall explain:  (i)  that under Pennsylvania law, donation of organs, tissues and vascularized composite
            allografts is a voluntary act;  (ii)  the difference between organs, tissues and vascularized composite allografts;  (iii)  that under Pennsylvania law, explicit and specific consent is needed to donate a vascularized
            composite allograft;  (iv)  that under Pennsylvania law, the request for a vascularized composite allograft must
            be made separately from a request for organs and tissues;  (v)  that the organ donor designation on the driver's license authorizes the individual
            to donate organs and tissue and does not authorize the individual to donate a vascularized
            composite allograft;  (vi)  that more information about organ donation, tissue donation and donation of vascularized
            composite allografts, including information about the procedure for recovering organs
            and other parts of the body and information about being declared dead through brain
            death and dead by lack of cardiac function, can be found on the Department of Transportation's
            publicly accessible Internet website; and  (vii)  that, before deciding whether to have an organ donor designation placed on the driver's
            license, the individual may consult with the individual's physician, attorney or clergy.  (3)  The Governor Robert P. Casey Memorial Organ and Tissue Donation Awareness Trust Fund
            shall reimburse the Department of Transportation for the costs incurred in the development
            and implementation of the informational insert program.  (b)  Electronic access.--The organ procurement organizations designated by the Federal
            Government in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as part of the nationwide organ procurement
            network [may] shall be given 24-hour-a-day electronic access to information necessary to confirm an individual's
            organ donor status through the Department of Transportation's driver licensing database.
            Necessary information shall include the individual's name, address, date of birth,
            driver's license number and organ donor status. Notwithstanding 75 Pa.C.S. § 6114
            (relating to limitation on sale, publication and disclosure of records), the Department
            of Transportation is authorized to provide the organ procurement organizations, after
            a written agreement between the Department of Transportation and the organ procurement
            organizations is first obtained, with the foregoing information. The organ procurement
            organization shall not use such information for any purpose other than to confirm
            an individual's organ donor status at or near or after an individual's death. The
            organ procurement organizations shall not be assessed the fee for such information
            prescribed by 75 Pa.C.S. § 1955(a) (relating to information concerning drivers and
            vehicles).  § 8621.  The Governor Robert P. Casey Memorial Organ and Tissue Donation Awareness Trust Fund
            contributions.  (a)  Driver's license.--  (1) Beginning as soon as practicable, but no later than [January 1, 1995] 10 months after the effective date of this paragraph , the Department of Transportation shall provide an applicant for an original or renewal
            driver's license or identification card the opportunity to make a contribution of
            [$1] $3 to the fund. The contribution shall be added to the regular fee for an original or
            renewal driver's license or identification card. One contribution may be made for
            each issuance or renewal of a license or identification card. Contributions shall
            be used exclusively for the purposes set out in section 8622 (relating to The Governor
            Robert P. Casey Memorial Organ and Tissue Donation Awareness Trust Fund).  (2) The Department of Transportation shall monthly determine the total amount designated
            under this section and shall report that amount to the State Treasurer, who shall
            transfer that amount to The Governor Robert P. Casey Memorial Organ and Tissue Donation
            Awareness Trust Fund.  (3)  The Governor Robert P. Casey Memorial Organ and Tissue Donation Awareness Trust Fund
            shall reimburse the Department of Transportation for the costs incurred in the initial
            development and implementation of the contribution program, as well as any additional
            costs that may arise from changes that are agreed to by both the Department of Transportation
            and the advisory committee.  (b)  Vehicle registration.--[The]  (1)  Beginning as soon as practicable, but no later than 10 months after the effective
               date of this paragraph, the Department of Transportation shall provide an applicant for a renewal vehicle registration
            the opportunity to make a contribution of [$1] $3 to The Governor Robert P. Casey Memorial Organ and Tissue Donation Awareness Trust
            Fund. The contribution shall be added to the regular fee for a renewal of a vehicle
            registration. One contribution may be made for each renewal vehicle registration.
            Contributions shall be used exclusively for the purposes described in section 8622.  (2) The Department of Transportation shall monthly determine the total amount designated
            under this section and shall report that amount to the State Treasurer, who shall
            transfer that amount to The Governor Robert P. Casey Memorial Organ and Tissue Donation

            Global and National Commerce Act or authorize electronic delivery of any of the notices
            described in section 103(b) of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce
            Act.  20180090u9s  Section 9.  Subchapter C of Chapter 86 of Title 20 is repealed:  [SUBCHAPTER C  CORNEAL TRANSPLANTS  Sec.  8641.  Removal of corneal tissue permitted under certain circumstances.  8642.  Limitation of liability.  § 8641.  Removal of corneal tissue permitted under certain circumstances.  (a)  General rule.--On a request from an authorized official of an eye bank for corneal
            tissue, a coroner or medical examiner may permit the removal of corneal tissue if
            all of the following apply:  (1)  The decedent from whom the tissue is to be removed died under circumstances requiring
            an inquest.  (2)  The coroner or medical examiner has made a reasonable effort to contact persons listed
            in section 8611 (relating to persons who may execute anatomical gift).  (3)  No objection by a person listed in section 8611 is known by the coroner or medical
            examiner.  (4)  The removal of the corneal tissue will not interfere with the subsequent course of
            an investigation or autopsy or alter the decedent's postmortem facial appearance.  (b)  Definition.--As used in this section, the term ""eye bank"" means a nonprofit corporation
            chartered under the laws of this Commonwealth to obtain, store and distribute donor
            eyes to be used by physicians or surgeons for corneal transplants, research or other
            medical purposes and the medical activities of which are directed by a physician or

            of the person.]  20180090u10s  Section 10.  Chapter 86 of Title 20 is amended by adding a subchapter to read:  SUBCHAPTER D  HANDS, FACIAL TISSUE, LIMBS AND OTHER  VASCULARIZED COMPOSITE ALLOGRAFTS  Sec.  8651.  Scope of subchapter.  8652.  Intent of General Assembly.  8653.  Definitions.  8654.  Requirement of explicit, specific and separate authorization.  8655.  Agents, next of kin and other surrogate decision makers.  8656.  Procedure for requesting hands, facial tissue, limbs and other vascularized composite
            allografts.  8657.  Gift of vascularized composite allograft from decedent whose death is under investigation.  8657.1. Notification by coroners and medical examiners to district attorneys.  8658.  Gifts of vascularized composite allografts.  8659.  Rights and protections for certain individuals.  8660.  Law on autopsies applicable.  8661.  Vital records.  8662.  Donees and vascularized composite allografts.  8663.  Dissemination of information prohibited.  8664.  Prohibited conduct.  8665.  Funeral establishments.  8666.  Limitation on liability.  § 8651.  Scope of subchapter.  This subchapter applies exclusively to hands, facial tissue, limbs and other vascularized
            composite allografts donated by an individual whose death is imminent or who has died
            in the hospital.  § 8652.  Intent of General Assembly.  It is the intent of the General Assembly to provide guidance to organ procurement
            organizations, hospitals, health care professionals and the public about the donation
            of hands, facial tissue, limbs and other vascularized composite allografts when donated
            by an individual whose death is imminent or who has died in the hospital. The General
            Assembly recognizes that a donation of a vascularized composite allograft from an
            individual whose death is imminent or who has died in the hospital, sometimes referred
            to as authorization for a vascularized composite allograft from a deceased donor,
            is a gift which must be given freely. In order to be given freely, explicit and specific
            consent must be obtained from donors or the donors' families. Obtaining explicit and
            specific consent is the only way to ensure transparency in the donation process and
            to preserve the public trust. It is the intention of the General Assembly to design
            policies and procedures to ensure that the donation of hands, facial tissue, limbs
            and other vascularized composite allografts from an individual whose death is imminent
            or who has died in the hospital is only made with explicit and specific consent.  § 8653.  Definitions.  The following words and phrases when used in this subchapter shall have the meanings
            given to them in this section unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:  ""Minor.""  An individual under 18 years of age.  ""Surrogate decision maker.""  An individual under section 8611(b)(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) or (8) (relating
            to persons who may execute anatomical gift).  § 8654.  Requirement of explicit, specific and separate authorization.  The following apply:  (1)  An individual of sound mind who is 18 years of age or older may authorize recovery
            of hands, facial tissue, limbs and other vascularized composite allografts. The authorization
            may be in a will, living will, health care power of attorney, power of attorney or
            other document. In order to be valid, the authorization must be in writing, witnessed
            by two other individuals and explicitly and specifically state that the individual
            authorizes the recovery of the individual's hands, facial tissue, limbs or other vascularized
            composite allografts. The authorization must be provided separately from an anatomical
            donation. If the individual explicitly, specifically and separately authorizes such
            a gift and requests reconstructive surgery, then the surgery shall be provided at
            no cost to the individual or the individual's family or representative. Any limitations
            on the provision of the gift authorized by the individual shall be honored by the
            hospital, a donee under section 8662 (relating to donees and vascularized composite
            allografts), health care professionals involved in the recovery and transplantation
            process, the organ procurement organizations and any other person involved with the
            donation and recovery of a vascularized composite allograft. If the individual authorizes
            a gift of hands, facial tissue, limbs or other vascularized composite allografts,
            then authorization of a surrogate decision maker shall not be necessary.  (2)  It is unlawful for a minor to authorize the donation of the minor's hands, facial
            tissue, limbs or other vascularized composite allografts. In the case of a minor  whose death is imminent or who has died in a hospital, a parent or guardian may authorize
            donation of the minor's  hands, facial tissue, limbs or other vascularized composite allografts if the parent
            or guardian does not have actual notice of contrary indications on the part of the
            minor with respect to making a donation of the minor's hands, facial tissue, limbs
            or other vascularized composite allografts and there is no actual notice of opposition
            by the other parent. If the parent or guardian has actual notice of contrary indications
            or there is actual notice of opposition by the other parent, then the parent or guardian
            is not authorized to make such a gift. The hospital, health care professionals, organ
            procurement organization and a donee under section 8662 shall not effectuate a donation
            if the minor evidenced contrary indications regarding donation of the minor's hands,
            facial tissue, limbs or other vascularized composite allografts or there is actual
            notice of opposition by the other parent.  (3)  A gift of a vascularized composite allograft under this section may be revoked or
            amended at any time and in the manner specified in section 8615 (relating to amendment
            or revocation of gift).  § 8655.  Agents, next of kin and other surrogate decision makers.  The following apply:  (1)  Subject to paragraph (2), a surrogate decision maker, in order of priority stated
            when persons in prior classes are not available at the time of death, and in the absence
            of actual notice of contrary indications by the decedent as set forth in subparagraph
            (ii) or evidence of a prohibition, amendment, revocation or denial of a gift of a
            vascularized composite allograft as set forth in subparagraph (i) or actual notice
            of opposition by a member of the same or a prior class, may authorize the donation
            of hands, facial tissue, limbs or other vascularized composite allografts of an individual
            who is at least 18 years of age and whose death is imminent or who has died in a hospital
            if:  (i)  there is no evidence of a prohibition, amendment, revocation or denial of a gift of
            hands, facial tissue, limbs and other vascularized composite allografts in a living
            will, will, advance health care directive, health care power of attorney, power of
            attorney or other document of the individual; and  (ii)  there is no actual notice of contrary indications by the individual regarding such
            a gift in any form, including through statements made by the individual to health
            care professionals, to family members or to the surrogate decision maker. If the surrogate
            decision maker has actual notice of contrary indications on the part of the individual
            with respect to making a donation of the individual's hands, facial tissue, limbs
            or other vascularized composite allografts, then it is unlawful for the surrogate
            decision maker to make such a gift. The hospital, health care professionals, donees
            under section 8662 (relating to donees and vascularized composite allografts) and
            organ procurement organization shall not effectuate a donation if the individual evidenced
            contrary indications regarding donation of the individual's hands, facial tissue,
            limbs or other vascularized composite allografts.  (2)  A surrogate decision maker may not authorize a gift of hands, facial tissue, limbs
            or other vascularized composite allografts on the part of an individual under paragraph
            (1) if any of the following apply:  (i)  The district attorney or a law enforcement officer notifies the organ procurement
            organization that the surrogate decision maker is a suspect or person of interest
            in causing the disease, illness, injury, condition or death of the individual.  (ii)  The surrogate decision maker is the subject of a protection from abuse order, an order
            issued under 42 Pa.C.S. Ch. 62A (relating to protection of victims of sexual violence
            or intimidation) or similar order from a court that was issued to the individual.  (iii)  The district attorney or a law enforcement officer notifies the organ procurement
            organization that the surrogate decision maker has been arrested or detained in connection
            with the disease, illness, injury, condition or death of the individual.  § 8656.  Procedure for requesting hands, facial tissue, limbs and other vascularized composite
            allografts.  The following applies to organ procurement organizations,  health care professionals, donees under section 8662 (relating to donees and vascularized
            composite allografts) and other persons who request a gift of hands, facial tissue,
            limbs and other vascularized composite allografts from a surrogate decision maker:  (1)  The request for a donation must be made separately from a request for donation under
            Subchapter B (relating to express anatomical gifts). The request must explicitly and
            specifically identify donations of hands, facial tissue, limbs and other vascularized
            composite allografts as distinct from traditional organs such as heart, liver, or
            lung or tissues under Subchapter B. The discussion must educate the surrogate decision
            maker about the process of recovery of vascularized composite allografts and must
            clearly define and explain all of the following:  (i)  What a vascularized composite allograft is, the benefit to the recipient and precisely
            what will be recovered.  (ii)  That any prior generalized authorization for an anatomical gift under Subchapter B
            does not include a gift of a hand, facial tissue, limb or other vascularized composite
            allograft.  (iii)  That permission for a gift of a hand, facial tissue, limb or other vascularized composite
            allograft must be given separately from the permission for a gift under Subchapter
            B.  (iv)  That the appearance of the individual whose death is imminent or who has died in a
            hospital will be significantly altered after the recovery of the gift and that upon
            request the recovery team will perform reconstructive surgery on the individual at
            no cost to the individual, the individual's family or surrogate decision maker. In
            addition, the discussion must explain that the recovery of vascularized composite
            allografts may impact burial arrangements and that an open casket may not be possible.  (v)  That the identity of the individual whose death is imminent or who has died in a hospital
            may not be able to be protected due to fingerprints or birthmarks.  (2)  A deceased donor authorization form shall be used which specifically identifies the
            option of authorizing a gift of hands, facial tissue, limbs and other vascularized
            composite allografts. The form must include a provision which states that the surrogate
            decision maker and family of the individual whose death is imminent or who has died
            in a hospital understands the relevant anatomical details of the donation, the alteration
            of the appearance of the individual, including the impact of the recovery of vascularized
            composite allografts upon funeral arrangements, and that, despite the best efforts
            of the organ procurement organization, the anonymity of the individual may not be
            protected. Further, the form must provide information about the nature of the discussion
            required under paragraph (1), including:  (i)  the date and time of the discussion;  (ii)  for individuals who hold a professional or occupational license, the names, addresses,
            telephone numbers and professional or occupational license numbers of the individuals
            who made the request for the donation and provided the information under paragraph
            (1); and  (iii)  a summary of the topics discussed and which surrogate decision maker authorized the
            gift of a vascularized composite allograft.  § 8657.  Gift of vascularized composite allograft from decedent whose death is under investigation.  (a)  Applicability.--This section shall apply in all cases when the coroner or medical
            examiner must determine the cause of death and whether the death may have resulted
            from criminal acts or criminal neglect.  (b)  Denial of recovery of vascularized composite allograft.--If a coroner or medical examiner
            is considering denying recovery of the vascularized composite allograft of an individual,
            the coroner or medical examiner shall comply with the procedure set forth in this
            subsection. The following apply:  (1)  The coroner or medical examiner or a designee shall meet with a medical advisory group
            composed of the individual's attending physician or a designee, the transplant surgeon
            or a designee and the applicable designated organ procurement organization at the
            hospital, during a reasonable time consistent with donation and preservation of forensic
            evidence. In addition, the forensic pathologist may participate as part of the medical
            advisory group by appearing in person at the hospital, by telephone or through electronic
            means.  (2)  The medical advisory group shall provide the coroner or medical examiner or a designee
            with the clinical findings of testing and medical procedures performed on the individual
            while at the hospital.  (3)  If, after the review of the testing and medical procedures set forth in paragraph
            (2), the coroner or medical examiner or a designee intends to deny recovery of the
            vascularized composite allograft, the coroner or medical examiner or a designee must
            provide a written statement explaining the reason for the denial. The statement shall
            be provided to the designated organ procurement organization upon request. The coroner
            or medical examiner or a designee shall ensure the written statement is made part
            of the coroner's or medical examiner's file. The written statement shall be exempt
            from the act of February 14, 2008 (P.L.6, No.3), known as the Right-to-Know Law.  (c)  Forms.--The coroner or medical examiner shall develop a form for the purpose of stating
            that the coroner or medical examiner has denied the recovery of the vascularized composite
            allograft as set forth in subsection (b). The coroner or medical examiner shall complete
            the form when denying recovery of the vascularized composite allograft as set forth
            in subsection (b).  § 8657.1.  Notification by coroners and medical examiners to district attorneys.  (a)  Applicability.--This section shall apply in all cases when the coroner or medical
            examiner:  (1)  must determine the cause of death and whether the death may have resulted from criminal

            decision maker of the option to make a gift of a vascularized composite allograft

            composite allograft.  (c)  Testing after death.--Subject to the individual's wishes under subsection (a)(3),
            after an individual's death, a person to whom an anatomical gift may pass under section
            8662 (relating to donees and vascularized composite allografts) may conduct a test

            personnel and other individuals involved in the process of recovering a vascularized
            composite allograft shall limit the testing and examination of the individual under
            this section so as to comply with the wishes of the individual under subsection (a)(3).  § 8659. Rights and protections for certain individuals.  (a)  General rule.--An individual who is in need of a vascularized composite allograft

            the physical or mental disability has been found by a physician or surgeon following
            an individualized evaluation of the individual to be medically significant to the
            provision of the vascularized composite allograft. If an individual has the necessary
            support system to assist the individual in complying with posttransplant medical requirements,
            an individual's inability to independently comply with those requirements shall not
            be deemed to be medically significant.  (b)  Definition.--As used in this section, the term ""disability"" shall have the same meaning
            as in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-336, 104 Stat. 327).  § 8660.  Law on autopsies applicable.  (a)  General rule.--Subject to the provisions of section 8657 (relating to gift of vascularized

This chapter relates to cancer trial access for Pennsylvania patients.  § 5402.  Legislative findings and intent.  (a)  Findings and declarations.--The General Assembly finds and declares as follows:  (1)  A Pennsylvanian will be diagnosed with cancer approximately every four minutes, and
            a Pennsylvanian will die of cancer every 10 minutes. African-American Pennsylvanians
            in particular face higher rates of cancer incidence and mortality compared to other
            races and ethnicities.  (2)  The ability to translate medical findings from research to practice relies largely
            on having robust and diverse patient participation in cancer clinical trials.  (3)  A low participation rate or a homogenous participant group prevents segments of the
            population from benefiting from advances achieved through clinical research, creates
            uncertainties over the applicability of research findings and has proven to develop
            lifesaving drugs that work for some ethnic populations but not others.  (4)  Conversely, some drug trials are canceled because they do not show promise for the
            current homogenous study population of patients but could be beneficial to other ethnicities
            who are not receiving the trial drug because of poor participation rates.  (5)  Diverse patient participation in cancer clinical trials depends, in part, on whether
            a participant can afford ancillary medical and other costs, including transportation
            for clinical visits required by trial participation, which are not covered by standard
            of care, or lodging during the course of his or her participation. A national study
            in 2015 found that patient households making less than $50,000 annually were almost
            30% less likely to participate in clinical trials.  (6)  Another barrier to cancer clinical trial participation is the cost of travel, lodging
            and other expenses for a patient's travel companion, including a family member, friend,
            health care provider or chaperone that attends cancer clinical trial treatments to
            provide emotional, physical and mental support to the trial participant. Some trial
            participants are too old, too young or too ill to simply travel on their own.  (7)  Cancer clinical trials often only cover the actual cost of the drug being tested and
            very rarely the direct costs of participation by a patient-subject. There are often
            significant expenses associated with enrollment in a clinical trial that are not covered
            by the clinical trial site or sponsor. These include travel expenses to and from the
            clinical sites whether by air, car, bus, train, taxi or public transportation along
            with the travel costs of parking, car rental, gas, tolls and lodging.  (8)  This disparity threatens one of the most basic ethical underpinnings of clinical research,
            the requirement that the benefits of research be made available equitably among all
            eligible individuals.  (9)  According to the National Cancer Institute, Cancer Clinical Trials Resource Guide,
            some of the barriers preventing individuals, with cancer or at high risk of developing
            cancer, from participating in clinical trials are direct and indirect financial and
            personal costs, including travel.  (10)  Some corporations, individuals, public and private foundations, health care providers
            and other stakeholders are hesitant to contribute to or accept funds from programs
            that are organized to alleviate financial burdens faced by patients who wish to participate
            in clinical trials and their caregivers due to concerns that the United States Food
            and Drug Administration or other Federal regulators would view the payments made from
            those funds as prohibited inducements for patients to receive the health care services
            provided during clinical trials.  (11)  While the United States Food and Drug Administration recently confirmed to Congress
            and provided guidance that, in fact, reimbursement of direct patient-incurred expenses
            is not inducement, many organizations, pharmaceutical companies, philanthropic individuals,
            charitable organizations, government entities and others still operate under the understanding
            that such reimbursement could be, in fact, considered inducement.  (b)  Intent.--It is the intent of the General Assembly to enact legislation to define and
            establish a clear difference between what is considered inducement for a patient to
            participate in a clinical trial and direct reimbursement of patient-incurred expenses
            for participating in a cancer clinical trial.  § 5403.  Definitions.  The following words and phrases when used in this chapter shall have the meanings
            given to them in this section unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:  ""Cancer clinical trials.""  Research studies that test new cancer treatments on people, including chemotherapies,

            to read:  Section 301.  Persons Who May be Subject to Involuntary Emergency Examination and Treatment.--(a)
             Persons Subject.--Whenever a person is severely mentally disabled and in need of immediate
            treatment, he may be made subject to involuntary emergency examination and treatment.
            A person is severely mentally disabled when, as a result of mental illness, his capacity
            to exercise self-control, judgment and discretion in the conduct of his affairs and
            social relations or to care for his own personal needs is so lessened that he poses
            a clear and present danger of harm to others or to himself ,  as defined in subsection (b), or the person is  determined to be in need of assisted outpatient treatment as  defined in subsection (c) .  * * *  (c)  Determination of Need for Assisted Outpatient Treatment.--(1)  The need for assisted outpatient treatment shall be shown by establishing by clear
            and convincing evidence that the person would benefit from assisted outpatient treatment
            as manifested by evidence of behavior that indicates all of the following:  (i)  The person is unlikely to survive safely in the community without supervision, based
            on a clinical determination.  (ii)  The person has a history of lack of voluntary adherence to treatment for mental illness
            and one of the following applies:  (A)  Within the 12 months prior to the filing of a petition seeking assisted outpatient
            treatment, the person's failure to adhere to treatment has been a significant factor
            in necessitating involuntary inpatient hospitalization or receipt of services in a
            forensic or other mental health unit of a correctional facility, provided that the
            12-month period shall be extended by the length of any hospitalization or incarceration
            of the person in a correctional institution that occurred within the 12-month period.  (B)  Within the 48 months prior to the filing of a petition seeking court-ordered assisted
            outpatient treatment, the person's failure to adhere to treatment resulted in one
            or more acts of serious violent behavior toward others or himself or threats of, or
            attempts at, serious physical harm to others or himself, provided that the 48-month
            period shall be extended by the length of any hospitalization or incarceration of
            the person in a correctional institution that occurred within the 48-month period.  (iii)  The person, as a result of the person's mental illness, is unlikely to voluntarily
            participate in necessary treatment and the person previously has been offered voluntary
            treatment services but has not accepted or has refused to participate on a sustained
            basis in voluntary treatment, provided that voluntary agreement to enter into services
            by a person during the pendency of a petition for assisted outpatient treatment shall
            not preclude the court from ordering assisted outpatient treatment for that person
            if reasonable evidence exists to believe that the person is unlikely to make a voluntary
            sustained commitment to and remain in a treatment program.  (iv)  Based on the person's treatment history and current behavior, the person is in need
            of treatment in order to prevent a relapse or deterioration that would be likely to
            result in substantial risk of serious harm to others or himself.  (2)  An individual who meets only the criteria described in clause (1) shall not be subject
            to involuntary inpatient hospitalization unless a separate determination is made that
            the individual poses a clear and present danger in accordance with subsection (b).  20180106u6s  Section 6.  Sections 302(b) and 303(c)(1) of the act are amended to read:  Section 302.  Involuntary Emergency Examination and Treatment Authorized by a Physician - Not to
            Exceed One Hundred Twenty Hours.--* * *  (b)  Examination and Determination of Need for Emergency Treatment.--A person taken to
            a facility shall be examined by a physician within two hours of arrival in order to
            determine if the person is severely mentally disabled within the meaning of section
            [301] 301(b) and in need of immediate treatment. If it is determined that the person is severely
            mentally disabled and in need of emergency treatment, treatment shall be begun immediately.
            If the physician does not so find, or if at any time it appears there is no longer
            a need for immediate treatment, the person shall be discharged and returned to such
            place as he may reasonably direct. The physician shall make a record of the examination
            and his findings. In no event shall a person be accepted for involuntary emergency
            treatment if a previous application was granted for such treatment and the new application
            is not based on behavior occurring after the earlier application.  * * *  Section 303.  Extended Involuntary Emergency Treatment Certified by a Judge or Mental Health Review
            Officer - Not to Exceed Twenty Days.--* * *  (c)  Informal Conference on Extended Emergency Treatment Application.--(1)  At the commencement of the informal conference, the judge or the mental health review
            officer shall inform the person of the nature of the proceedings. Information relevant
            to whether the person is severely mentally disabled and in need of treatment shall
            be reviewed, including the reasons that continued involuntary treatment is considered
            necessary. Such explanation shall be made by a physician who examined the person and
            shall be in terms understandable to a layman. The judge or mental health review officer
            may review any relevant information even if it would be normally excluded under rules
            of evidence if he believes that such information is reliable. The person or his representative
            shall have the right to ask questions of the physician and of any other witnesses
            and to present any relevant information. At the conclusion of the review, if the judge
            or the review officer finds that the person is severely mentally disabled and in need
            of continued involuntary treatment, either as an inpatient or through less  restrictive assisted outpatient treatment, he shall so certify. Otherwise, he shall direct that the facility director or his
            designee discharge the person.  * * *  20180106u7s  Section 7.  Section 304(a), (e), (f) and (g) of the act are amended and the section is amended
            by adding subsections to read:  Section 304.  Court-ordered Involuntary Treatment Not to Exceed Ninety Days.--(a)  Persons for Whom Application May be Made.--(1)  A person who is severely mentally disabled and in need of treatment, as defined in
            section 301(a), may be made subject to court-ordered involuntary treatment upon a
            determination of clear and present danger under section 301(b)(1) (serious bodily
            harm to others), or section 301(b)(2)(i) (inability to care for himself, creating
            a danger of death or serious harm to himself), or 301(b)(2)(ii) (attempted suicide),
            or 301(b)(2)(iii) (self-mutilation) , or upon determination that  a person meets the requirements under section 301(c)  (determination of need for assisted outpatient treatment) .  (2)  Where a petition is filed for a person already subject to involuntary treatment, it
            shall be sufficient to represent, and upon hearing to reestablish, that the conduct
            originally required by section [301] 301(b) in fact occurred, and that his condition continues to evidence a clear and present
            danger to himself or others , or that the conduct originally required by  section 301(c) in fact occurred and that his condition continues  to evidence a need for assisted outpatient treatment . In such event, it shall not be necessary to show the reoccurrence of dangerous conduct,

            that has agreed to provide the service.  (ii)  In developing a written proposed assisted outpatient treatment plan, the treatment
            team shall take into account, if existing, an advance directive for mental health
            treatment and provide the following persons with an opportunity to participate:  (A)  the person believed to be in need of court-ordered assistant outpatient treatment;  (B)  all current treating providers;  (C)  upon the request of the person believed to be in need of court-ordered assistant outpatient

            assisted outpatient treatment services recommended by the treatment team. If the plan
            includes medication, the prescribing physician's order shall state whether such medication
            should be self-administered or administered by a specified provider. In no event shall
            the plan recommend the use of physical force or restraints to administer medication
            to the person.  (iv)  A qualified professional, who has personally examined the person within ten days of

            outpatient treatment and the facts that establish that such treatment is the least
            restrictive appropriate alternative;  (B)  information regarding the person's access to, and the availability of, recommended
            assisted outpatient treatment in the community or elsewhere; and  (C)  if the recommended assisted outpatient treatment includes medication, the types or
            classes of medication that should be authorized, the beneficial and detrimental physical
            and mental effects of such medication and whether such medication should be self-administered
            or administered by a specified provider and the ongoing process for management of
            such medications in response to changes in the person's medical condition.  (9)  A decision shall be rendered within 48 hours after the close of evidence.  (f)  Determination and Order.-- (1) Upon a finding by clear and convincing evidence that the person is severely mentally
            disabled and in need of treatment and subject to subsection (a), an order shall be
            entered directing treatment of the person in an approved facility as an inpatient
            or an outpatient, or a combination of such treatment as the director of the facility
            shall from time to time determine. Inpatient treatment shall be deemed appropriate
            only after full consideration has been given to less restrictive alternatives , including assisted outpatient  treatment . Investigation of treatment alternatives shall include consideration of the person's
            relationship to his community and family, his employment possibilities, all available
            community resources, and guardianship services. An order for inpatient treatment shall
            include findings on this issue.  (2)  If the person is found to be in need of assisted outpatient treatment in accordance
            with section 301(c) or as a result of consideration of less restrictive settings under
            clause (1), the court shall order the person to receive assisted outpatient treatment
            for a period not to exceed 90 days from any provider or facility approved by the department
            or the county administrator for purposes of providing assisted outpatient treatment,
            provided that a jail or any other State or county correctional institution shall not
            be an authorized facility.  (3)  The facility or provider shall examine and treat the person in accordance with the
            assisted outpatient treatment plan. If the person is receiving assisted outpatient
            treatment, or receives treatment in an outpatient setting during a subsequent period
            of continued commitment under section 305, the facility or provider to whom the person
            is ordered shall determine the appropriate assisted outpatient treatment plan for
            the person.  (4)  If the approved court-ordered assisted outpatient treatment plan includes medications,
            the court order shall authorize the treatment team, in accordance with their professional
            judgment and under supervision of the prescribing physician, to perform routine medication
            management, including adjustment of specific medications and doses, in consultation
            with the person and as warranted by changes in the person's medical condition.  (5)  The provider or facility responsible for the assisted outpatient treatment plan shall
            inform the court if the person fails materially to adhere to the treatment plan and
            comply with the court order. If the court receives information that a patient is not
            complying with the court's order, the court may take any of the following actions:  (i)  set a modification hearing to assess the person's failure to adhere to the assisted
            outpatient treatment plan;  (ii)  amend the assisted outpatient treatment plan to foster adherence to necessary treatment
            by the person; or  (iii)  issue an order for the person to be examined in accordance with section 302 for purposes
            of evaluation and, if appropriate, file a petition that the person poses a clear and
            present danger under section 301(b), provided that a State or county correctional
            institution may not be considered an authorized treatment facility.  (6)  If the court determines under clause (5) that the person has failed to adhere to the
            assisted outpatient treatment plan, the court may not hold that person in contempt
            or otherwise sanction the person solely based on the failure to comply with the assisted
            outpatient treatment plan.  (7)  The person subject to assisted outpatient treatment may petition the court for enforcement
            of a service specifically contained in that person's individualized treatment plan,
            provided that the petition must include clear and convincing evidence demonstrating
            that the service is not being provided in accordance with that plan.  (8)  A copy of the person's individualized treatment plan and related documents shall be
            made available to the court for purposes of proceedings under clause (5) or (7).  (g)  Duration of Court-ordered Involuntary Treatment.--(1)  A person may be made subject to court-ordered involuntary treatment under this section
            for a period not to exceed 90 days, excepting only that: Persons may be made subject
            to court-ordered involuntary treatment under this section for a period not to exceed
            one year if :  (i) the person meets the criteria established by clause (2)[.] ; and  (ii)  the person may be subject to assisted outpatient treatment for a period not to exceed
            180 days if the person meets the criteria established by clause (5).  (2)  A person may be subject to court-ordered involuntary treatment for a period not to
            exceed one year if:  (i)  severe mental disability is based on acts giving rise to the following charges under
            the Pennsylvania Crimes Code: murder (§ 2502); voluntary manslaughter (§ 2503); aggravated
            assault (§ 2702); kidnapping (§ 2901); rape (§ 3121(1) and (2)); involuntary deviate
            sexual intercourse (§ 3123(1) and (2)); arson (§ 3301); and  (ii)  a finding of incompetency to be tried or a verdict of acquittal because of lack of
            criminal responsibility has been entered.  (3)  If at any time the director of a facility concludes that the person is not severely
            mentally disabled or in need of treatment pursuant to subsection (a), he shall discharge
            the person provided that no person subjected to involuntary treatment pursuant to
            clause (2) may be discharged without a hearing conducted pursuant to clause (4).  (4)  In cases involving involuntary treatment pursuant to clause (2), whenever the period
            of court-ordered involuntary treatment is about to expire and neither the director
            nor the county administrator intends to apply for an additional period of court-ordered
            involuntary treatment pursuant to section 305 or at any time the director concludes
            that the person is not severely mentally disabled or in need of treatment, the director
            shall petition the court which ordered the involuntary treatment for the unconditional
            or conditional release of the person. Notice of such petition shall be given to the
            person, the county administrator and the district attorney. Within 15 days after the
            petition has been filed, the court shall hold a hearing to determine if the person
            is severely mentally disabled and in need of treatment. Petitions which must be filed
            simply because the period of involuntary treatment will expire shall be filed at least
            ten days prior to the expiration of the court-ordered period of involuntary treatment.
            If the court determines after hearing that the person is severely mentally disabled
            and in need of treatment, it may order additional involuntary treatment not to exceed
            one year; if the court does not so determine, it shall order the discharge of the
            person.  (5)  A person may be subject to assisted outpatient treatment for a period of up to 180
            days if the person continues to meet the requirements of section 301(c) or is being
            discharged from involuntary inpatient treatment under this article.  20180106u8s  Section 8.  Section 305 of the act is amended by adding a subsection to read:  Section 305.  Additional Periods of Court-ordered Involuntary Treatment.--* * *  (c)  At the expiration of a period of assisted outpatient treatment under section 304(g)
            or this section, the court may order treatment for an additional period upon the application
            of the county administrator or the treatment team. Such order shall be entered upon
            hearing on findings as required by sections 304(a) and (b) and the further finding
            of a need for continuing assisted outpatient treatment. The additional period of involuntary
            treatment shall not exceed 180 days.  20180106u9s  Section 9.  This act shall take effect in 180 days.    APPROVED--The 24th day of October, A.D. 2018.    TOM WOLF   "

            Compensation Act, is repealed and the section is amended by adding a clause to read:  Section 306.  The following schedule of compensation is hereby established:  * * *  [(a.2)  (1)  When an employe has received total disability compensation pursuant to clause (a)
            for a period of one hundred four weeks, unless otherwise agreed to, the employe shall
            be required to submit to a medical examination which shall be requested by the insurer
            within sixty days upon the expiration of the one hundred four weeks to determine the
            degree of impairment due to the compensable injury, if any. The degree of impairment
            shall be determined based upon an evaluation by a physician who is licensed in this
            Commonwealth, who is certified by an American Board of Medical Specialties approved
            board or its osteopathic equivalent and who is active in clinical practice for at
            least twenty hours per week, chosen by agreement of the parties, or as designated
            by the department, pursuant to the most recent edition of the American Medical Association
            ""Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment.""  (2)  If such determination results in an impairment rating that meets a threshold impairment
            rating that is equal to or greater than fifty per centum impairment under the most
            recent edition of the American Medical Association ""Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent
            Impairment,"" the employe shall be presumed to be totally disabled and shall continue
            to receive total disability compensation benefits under clause (a). If such determination
            results in an impairment rating less than fifty per centum impairment under the most
            recent edition of the American Medical Association ""Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent
            Impairment,"" the employe shall then receive partial disability benefits under clause
            (b): Provided, however, That no reduction shall be made until sixty days' notice of
            modification is given.  (3)  Unless otherwise adjudicated or agreed to based upon a determination of earning power
            under clause (b)(2), the amount of compensation shall not be affected as a result
            of the change in disability status and shall remain the same. An insurer or employe
            may, at any time prior to or during the five hundred-week period of partial disability,
            show that the employe's earning power has changed.  (4)  An employe may appeal the change to partial disability at any time during the five
            hundred-week period of partial disability; Provided, That there is a determination
            that the employe meets the threshold impairment rating that is equal to or greater
            than fifty per centum impairment under the most recent edition of the American Medical
            Association ""Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment.""  (5)  Total disability shall continue until it is adjudicated or agreed under clause (b)
            that total disability has ceased or the employe's condition improves to an impairment
            rating that is less than fifty per centum of the degree of impairment defined under
            the most recent edition of the American Medical Association ""Guides to the Evaluation
            of Permanent Impairment.""  (6)  Upon request of the insurer, the employe shall submit to an independent medical examination
            in accordance with the provisions of section 314 to determine the status of impairment:
            Provided, however, That for purposes of this clause, the employe shall not be required
            to submit to more than two independent medical examinations under this clause during
            a twelve-month period.  (7)  In no event shall the total number of weeks of partial disability exceed five hundred
            weeks for any injury or recurrence thereof, regardless of the changes in status in
            disability that may occur. In no event shall the total number of weeks of total disability
            exceed one hundred four weeks for any employe who does not meet a threshold impairment
            rating that is equal to or greater than fifty per centum impairment under the most
            recent edition of the American Medical Association ""Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent
            Impairment"" for any injury or recurrence thereof.  (8)  (i)  For purposes of this clause, the term ""impairment"" shall mean an anatomic or functional
            abnormality or loss that results from the compensable injury and is reasonably presumed
            to be permanent.  (ii)  For purposes of this clause, the term ""impairment rating"" shall mean the percentage
            of permanent impairment of the whole body resulting from the compensable injury. The
            percentage rating for impairment under this clause shall represent only that impairment
            that is the result of the compensable injury and not for any preexisting work-related
            or nonwork-related impairment.]  (a.3)  (1)  When an employe has received total disability compensation pursuant to clause (a)
            for a period of one hundred and four weeks, unless otherwise agreed to, the employe
            shall be required to submit to a medical examination which shall be requested by the
            insurer within sixty days upon the expiration of the one hundred and four weeks to
            determine the degree of impairment due to the compensable injury, if any. The degree
            of impairment shall be determined based upon an evaluation by a physician who is licensed
            in this Commonwealth, who is certified by an American Board of Medical Specialties-approved
            board or its osteopathic equivalent and who is active in clinical practice for at
            least twenty hours per week, chosen by agreement of the parties, or as designated
            by the department, pursuant to the American Medical Association ""Guides to the Evaluation
            of Permanent Impairment,"" 6th edition (second printing April 2009).  (2)  If such determination results in an impairment rating that meets a threshold impairment
            rating that is equal to or greater than thirty-five per centum impairment under the
            American Medical Association ""Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment,"" 6th
            edition (second printing April 2009), the employe shall be presumed to be totally
            disabled and shall continue to receive total disability compensation benefits under
            clause (a). If such determination results in an impairment rating less than thirty-five
            per centum impairment under the American Medical Association ""Guides to the Evaluation
            of Permanent Impairment,"" 6th edition (second printing April 2009), the employe shall
            then receive partial disability benefits under clause (b): Provided, however, That
            no reduction shall be made until sixty days' notice of modification is given.  (3)  Unless otherwise adjudicated or agreed to based upon a determination of earning power
            under clause (b)(2), the amount of compensation shall not be affected as a result
            of the change in disability status and shall remain the same. An insurer or employe
            may, at any time prior to or during the five hundred-week period of partial disability,
            show that the employe's earning power has changed.  (4)  An employe may appeal the change to partial disability at any time during the five
            hundred-week period of partial disability; Provided, That there is a determination
            that the employe meets the threshold impairment rating that is equal to or greater
            than thirty-five per centum impairment under the American Medical Association ""Guides
            to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment,"" 6th edition (second printing April 2009).  (5)  Total disability shall continue until it is adjudicated or agreed under clause (b)
            that total disability has ceased or the employe's condition improves to an impairment
            rating that is less than thirty-five per centum of the degree of impairment defined
            under the American Medical Association ""Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment,""
            6th edition (second printing April 2009).  (6)  Upon request of the insurer, the employe shall submit to an independent medical examination
            in accordance with the provisions of section 314 to determine the status of impairment:
            Provided, however, That for purposes of this clause, the employe shall not be required
            to submit to more than two independent medical examinations under this clause during
            a twelve-month period.  (7)  In no event shall the total number of weeks of partial disability exceed five hundred
            weeks for any injury or recurrence thereof, regardless of the changes in status in
            disability that may occur. In no event shall the total number of weeks of total disability
            exceed one hundred and four weeks for any employe who does not meet a threshold impairment
            rating that is equal to or greater than thirty-five per centum impairment under the
            American Medical Association ""Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment,"" 6th
            edition (second printing April 2009), for any injury or recurrence thereof.  (8)  (i)  For purposes of this clause, the term ""impairment"" shall mean an anatomic or functional
            abnormality or loss that results from the compensable injury and is reasonably presumed
            to be permanent.  (ii)  For purposes of this clause, the term ""impairment rating"" shall mean the percentage
            of permanent impairment of the whole body resulting from the compensable injury. The
            percentage rating for impairment under this clause shall represent only that impairment
            that is the result of the compensable injury and not for any preexisting work-related
            or nonwork-related impairment.  * * *  20180111u2s  Section 2.  Sections 307(7) and 314(b) of the act are amended to read:  Section 307.  In case of death, compensation shall be computed on the following basis, and distributed
            to the following persons: Provided, That in no case shall the wages of the deceased
            be taken to be less than fifty per centum of the Statewide average weekly wage for
            purposes of this section:  * * *  (7)  Whether or not there be dependents as aforesaid, the reasonable expense of burial,
            not exceeding [three thousand dollars ($3,000)] seven thousand dollars ($7,000) , which shall be paid by the employer or insurer directly to the undertaker (without
            deduction of any amounts theretofore paid for compensation or for medical expenses).  * * *  Section 314.  * * *  (b)  In the case of a physical examination, the employe shall be entitled to have a health
            care provider of his own selection, to be paid by him, participate in such examination
            requested by his employer or ordered by the workers' compensation judge. In instances
            where an examination is requested in relation to section [306(a.2)(1)] 306(a.3)(1) , such examination shall be performed by a physician who is licensed in this Commonwealth,
            who is certified by an American Board of Medical Specialties approved board or its
            osteopathic equivalent and who is in active clinical practice for at least twenty
            (20) hours per week.  20180111u3s  Section 3.  The following shall apply:  (1)  For the purposes of determining whether an employee shall submit to a medical examination
            to determine the degree of impairment and whether an employee has received total disability
            compensation for the period of 104 weeks under section 306(a.3)(1) of the act, an
            insurer shall be given credit for weeks of total disability compensation paid prior
            to the effective date of this paragraph. This section shall not be construed to alter
            the requirements of section 306(a.3) of the act.  (2)  For the purposes of determining the total number of weeks of partial disability compensation
            payable under section 306(a.3)(7) of the act, an insurer shall be given credit for
            weeks of partial disability compensation paid prior to the effective date of this
            paragraph.  (3)  Within 90 days following the effective date of the addition of section 306(a.3) of
            the act, the Pennsylvania Compensation Rating Bureau shall calculate the savings achieved
            through the implementation of that subsection. Immediately following this calculation,
            the amount of savings shall be used to provide an immediate reduction in rates, equal
            to the savings, applicable to employers' workers' compensation policies.  20180111u4s  Section 4.  This act shall take effect immediately.    APPROVED--The 24th day of October, A.D. 2018.    TOM WOLF   "

This act shall be known and may be cited as the Intergovernmental Cooperation Authorities
            Act for Cities of the Third Class.  20180124u102s  Section 102.  Purpose and legislative intent.  (a)  Policy.--It is hereby declared to be a public policy of the Commonwealth to exercise
            its retained sovereign powers with regard to taxation and matters of Statewide concern
            in a manner calculated to foster the fiscal integrity of cities of the third class
            to assure that they:  (1)  provide for the health, safety and welfare of their residents;  (2)  pay principal and interest owed on their debt obligations when due;  (3)  meet financial obligations to their employees, vendors and suppliers; and  (4)  provide for proper financial planning procedures and budgeting practices.  The inability of a city of the third class to provide essential services to its residents
            as a result of a fiscal emergency is determined to affect adversely the health, safety
            and welfare not only of the residents of the city, but also of other residents of
            this Commonwealth.  (b)  Legislative intent.--  (1)  It is the intent of the General Assembly to:  (i)  provide cities of the third class with the legal tools with which they can perform
            essential municipal services; and  (ii)  foster sound financial planning and budgetary practices for cities of the third class,
            which cities will be charged with the responsibility to exercise efficient and accountable
            fiscal practices, such as:  (A)  increased managerial accountability;  (B)  consolidation or elimination of inefficient city programs and authorities;  (C)  reevaluation of tax exemption policies with regard to real property taxes;  (D)  increased collection of existing tax revenues;  (E)  privatization or outsourcing of appropriate city services;  (F)  sale of city assets as appropriate;  (G)  improvement of procurement practices, including competitive bidding procedures; and  (H)  review of compensation and benefits of city employees.  (2)  This act is intended to remedy the apparent fiscal emergency confronting cities of
            the third class through the implementation of sovereign powers of the Commonwealth.
            To safeguard the rights of the residents of this Commonwealth to the electoral process
            and home rule, the General Assembly intends to exercise its power in an appropriate
            manner with the elected officers of cities of the third class.  20180124u103s  Section 103.  Legislative findings.  It is hereby determined and declared as a matter of legislative finding that:  (1)  Some cities of the third class have encountered recurring financial difficulties that
            may affect the performance of necessary municipal services to the detriment of the
            health, safety and general welfare of residents of those cities.  (2)  It is critically important that cities of the third class maintain their creditworthiness.  (3)  Due to the economic and social interrelationship among all residents in our economy,
            the fiscal integrity of cities of the third class is a matter of concern to all residents
            of this Commonwealth, and the financial problems of these cities have a direct and
            negative effect on the entire Commonwealth.  (4)  Because cities of the third class consume a substantial proportion of the products
            of Pennsylvania's farms, factories, manufacturing plants and service enterprises,
            economic difficulties confronting cities of the third class detrimentally affect the
            economy of the Commonwealth as a whole and become a matter of Statewide concern.  (5)  Because residents of cities of the third class contribute a substantial proportion
            of all Commonwealth tax revenues, a disruption of the economic and social life of
            these cities may have a significant detrimental effect on Commonwealth revenues.  (6)  The financial difficulties of cities of the third class can best be addressed and
            resolved by cooperation between governmental entities.  (7)  The Constitution of Pennsylvania grants municipalities authority to cooperate with
            other governmental entities in the exercise of any function or responsibility.  (8)  The Commonwealth retains certain sovereign powers with respect to cities of the third
            class, among them the powers to authorize and levy taxes, to authorize the incurring
            of indebtedness and to provide financial assistance that may be necessary to assist
            cities in solving their financial problems.  (9)  The Commonwealth may attach conditions to grants of authority to incur indebtedness
            or assistance to cities of the third class in order to ensure that deficits are eliminated
            and access to capital markets is achieved and maintained.  (10)  The conditions must be incorporated into intergovernmental cooperation agreements
            between the Commonwealth or its instrumentalities and cities of the third class.  (11)  Cities of the third class and the Commonwealth will benefit from the creation of an
            independent authority composed of members experienced in finance and management that
            advises the cities, the General Assembly and the Governor concerning solutions to
            fiscal problems cities of the third class may face.  (12)  The creation of an authority will allow cities of the third class to continue to provide
            the necessary municipal services for their residents and to contribute to the economy
            of this Commonwealth.  20180124u104s  Section 104.  Definitions.  The following words and phrases when used in this act shall have the meanings given

            become both measurable and available.  (ii)  Estimates of city-generated revenues shall be based on current or proposed tax rates,
            historical collection patterns and generally recognized econometric models.  (iii)  Estimates of revenues to be received from the Commonwealth shall be based on historical
            patterns, currently available levels or on levels proposed in a budget by the Governor.  (iv)  Estimates of revenues to be received from the Federal Government shall be based on
            historical patterns, currently available levels or on levels proposed in a budget

            period following the close of the current fiscal year and all obligations of prior
            fiscal years not covered by encumbered funds from prior fiscal years.  (vii)  Any deviations from these standards of estimating revenues and appropriations proposed
            to be used by an assisted city shall be specifically disclosed and must be approved
            by a majority of the board.  (3)  All cash flow projections shall be based on prudent, reasonable and appropriate assumptions
            as to sources and uses of cash, including, but not limited to, prudent, reasonable
            and appropriate assumptions as to the timing of receipt and expenditure thereof, and
            shall provide for operations of the assisted city to be conducted within the resources
            so projected. All estimates shall take due account of the past and anticipated collection,
            expenditure and service demand experience of the assisted city and of current and
            projected economic conditions.  (d)  Form of plan.--Each financial plan shall include, consistent with the requirements
            of an assisted city's governing law:  (1)  For each of the first two fiscal years covered by the financial plan, information
            that reflects an assisted city's total expenditures by fund and by lump sum amount
            for each board, commission, department or office of an assisted city.  (2)  For the remaining three fiscal years of the financial plan, information that reflects
            an assisted city's total expenditures by fund and by lump sum amount for major object

            the assisted city shall develop and the authority shall review and act upon an initial
            five-year financial plan that includes a report on the status of implementation of
            prior published suggestions regarding consolidation and cost savings.  (2)  During each subsequent fiscal year, the chief fiscal officer of the assisted city
            shall, at least 100 days prior to the beginning of the assisted city's fiscal year
            or on another date as the authority may approve upon the request of the assisted city,
            prepare and submit its proposed five-year plan.  (3)  At the same time the plan is submitted, the chief fiscal officer shall also submit
            to the authority:  (i)  The chief fiscal officer's proposed annual operating budget and capital budget, which
            budgets shall be consistent with the first year of the financial plan and prepared
            in accordance with the assisted city's governing law.  (ii)  A statement by the chief fiscal officer that the budget:  (A)  Is consistent with the financial plan.  (B)  Contains funding adequate for debt service payments, legally mandated services and

            ordinances of the assisted city or State law.  (f)  Balanced budget requirement.--  (1)  The chief fiscal officer of the assisted city shall submit, and the governing body
            of the city or assisted city shall adopt, a balanced budget each year consistent with
            the assisted city's governing law.  (2)  A balanced budget of an assisted city may not include projected revenues that in order
            to be collected require the enactment by the General Assembly of new taxing powers
            or the approval of a court of common pleas of the county in which the assisted city
            is located.  (3)  The failure of the assisted city to comply with this subsection shall result in the
            withholding of Commonwealth funds under section 210(e) and (f).  (g)  Authority review and approval of plan.--  (1)  The authority shall promptly review each financial plan, proposed operating budget
            and capital budget submitted by the assisted city. In conducting the review, the authority
            shall request from the controller of the assisted city an opinion or certification,
            prepared in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, with respect to
            the reasonableness of the assumptions and estimates in the financial plan.  (2)  The controller and other elected officials of the assisted city shall comply with
            a request under paragraph (1).  (3)  Not more than 30 days after submission of a financial plan and proposed operating
            budget, the authority shall determine whether:  (i)  The financial plan projects balanced budgets, based upon prudent, reasonable and appropriate
            assumptions as described in this section, for each year of the plan.  (ii)  The proposed operating budget and capital budget are consistent with the proposed
            financial plan.  (4)  If the authority determines that the criteria under paragraph (3) are satisfied, the
            authority shall approve the financial plan.  (5)  The authority shall not be bound by any opinion or certification of the controller
            or other official of an assisted city issued under this subsection.  (6)  If the authority fails to take any action regarding a financial plan within 30 days
            following submission of the plan to the authority, the financial plan as submitted
            shall be deemed approved. If, during the 30-day period, a written request by two members
            of the board for a meeting and vote on the question of approval of the financial plan
            has been submitted to the chairperson and a meeting and vote do not take place, the
            financial plan shall be deemed disapproved.  (h)  Authority disapproval of plan.--  (1)  If the authority disapproves the proposed financial plan of the assisted city, the
            authority shall, when it notifies the assisted city of the authority's decision, state
            in writing in reasonable detail the reasons for the disapproval, including the amount
            of any estimated budget imbalance.  (2)  The assisted city shall submit a revised financial plan to the authority within 15
            days of a disapproval under paragraph (1), and the revised plan must eliminate the
            budget imbalance.  (3)  Not more than 15 days after the submission of the revised financial plan, the authority
            shall determine whether the revised plan satisfies the criteria under subsection (g)(3).  (4)  If the authority determines that the criteria are satisfied, the authority shall approve
            the financial plan.  (5)  If the authority fails to approve the financial plan, the authority shall, in accordance
            with section 210(e), certify the assisted city's noncompliance with the financial
            plan to the Secretary of the Budget, the President pro tempore of the Senate and the
            Speaker of the House of Representatives.  (i)  Revisions to plan.--  (1)  The plan shall be revised on an annual basis to include the operating budget for the
            next fiscal year and to extend the plan for an additional fiscal year. The chief fiscal
            officer of an assisted city shall, within 90 days of assuming office, propose revisions
            to the financial plan or certify to the authority that the chief fiscal officer adopts
            the existing plan.  (2)  An assisted city may, during the course of a fiscal year, submit proposed revisions
            to the financial plan and shall submit a proposed revision for any amendment to the
            city's operating or capital budget.  (3)  The authority shall review each proposed revision within 20 days of its submission.
            The authority shall approve the revision if it will not, based on prudent, reasonable
            and appropriate assumptions, cause the plan to become imbalanced.  (4)  Proposed revisions shall become part of the financial plan upon the approval of the
            authority unless some other method of approval is permitted by authority rules and
            regulations approved by the board or pursuant to an agreement with the assisted city
            contained in an intergovernmental cooperation agreement.  (5)  If the authority fails to take action within 20 days on a proposed revision, the submission
            shall be deemed approved unless a written request for a meeting and vote has been
            made in accordance with subsection (g)(4), in which event, if a meeting and vote do
            not take place, the proposed revision shall be deemed disapproved.  (6)  If the governing body of a city adopts a budget inconsistent with an approved financial
            plan, the assisted city shall submit the enacted budget to the authority as a proposed
            revision to the plan. The authority shall review the proposed revision within 30 days
            of its submission in accordance with the criteria under subsection (g) and the approval
            process under paragraph (3).  (j)  Supplemental reports.--  (1)  Within 45 days of the end of each fiscal quarter of an assisted city, or monthly if
            a variation from the financial plan has been determined in accordance with section
            210(c), the chief fiscal officer of the assisted city shall provide the authority
            with a report describing actual or current estimates of revenues and expenditures
            compared to budgeted revenues and expenditures for the period reflected in the assisted
            city's cash flow forecast.  (2)  A report required under this section shall indicate any variance between actual or
            current estimates and budgeted revenues, expenditures and cash for the period covered
            by the report.  (3)  An assisted city shall also provide periodic reports on debt service requirements
            in conformity with section 210(b).  (k)  Effect of plan upon contracts and collective bargaining agreements.--  (1)  A contract or collective bargaining agreement in existence in an assisted city prior
            to the approval by the authority of a financial plan submitted under this section
            shall remain effective after approval of the plan until the contract or agreement
            expires.  (2)  After the approval by the authority of a financial plan submitted pursuant to this
            section, an assisted city shall execute contracts and collective bargaining agreements
            in compliance with the plan. If an assisted city executes a contract or a collective
            bargaining agreement which is not in compliance with the plan, the contract or agreement
            shall not be void or voidable solely by reason of the noncompliance, but the assisted
            city shall submit to the authority a proposed revision to the plan which demonstrates
            that revenues sufficient to pay the costs of the contract or collective bargaining
            agreement will be available in the affected fiscal years of the plan.  (3)  Nothing in this act shall be construed to in any manner violate, expand or diminish
            the provisions of the Municipalities Financial Recovery Act relating to collective
            bargaining agreements.  (l)  Effect of plan upon certain arbitration settlements.--  (1)  After the approval by the authority of a financial plan submitted pursuant to this
            section, any arbitration settlement of a board of arbitration established pursuant
            to the provisions of the act of June 24, 1968 (P.L.237, No.111), referred to as the
            Policemen and Firemen Collective Bargaining Act, providing for an increase in wages
            or fringe benefits of an employee of an assisted city under the plan, in addition
            to considering any standard or factor required to be considered by applicable law,
            shall take into consideration and accord substantial weight to:  (i)  the approved financial plan; and  (ii)  relevant market factors, such as the financial situation of the assisted city, inflation,
            productivity, size of workforce and pay and benefit levels in economically and demographically
            comparable political subdivisions.  (2)  The arbitration settlement shall be in writing and a copy thereof shall be forwarded
            to each party to the dispute and the authority. Any arbitration settlement of the
            board of arbitration which provides for an increase in wages or fringe benefits of
            an employee of an assisted city shall be in writing and shall state with specificity
            all factors which the board of arbitration took into account in considering and giving
            substantial weight to the factors referred to in paragraph (1).  (3)  Any party to a proceeding before a board of arbitration may appeal to the court of
            common pleas to review:  (i)  consideration under paragraph (1); or  (ii)  failure of the board of arbitration to issue an arbitration settlement under paragraph
            (2).  (4)  An appeal under paragraph (3) must be commenced not later than 30 days after the issuance
            of a final arbitration settlement by the board of arbitration.  (5)  The decision of the board of arbitration shall be vacated and remanded to the board
            of arbitration if the court finds:  (i)  that the board of arbitration failed to take into consideration and accord substantial
            weight to the factors referred to in paragraph (1); or  (ii)  that the board of arbitration has failed to issue an arbitration settlement under
            paragraph (2).  (6)  If, after the exhaustion of all appeals, the final arbitration settlement is not in
            compliance with the approved financial plan, the arbitration settlement shall not
            be void or voidable solely by reason of such noncompliance, but the assisted city
            shall submit to the authority a proposed revision to the plan which demonstrates that
            revenues sufficient to pay the costs of the arbitration settlement will be available
            in the affected fiscal years of the plan.  (7)  As used in this subsection, the term ""arbitration settlement"" shall mean an adjustment
            or settlement of a collective bargaining agreement or dispute. The term includes a
            final or binding arbitration award or other determination.  20180124u210s  Section 210.  Powers and duties of authority with respect to financial plans.  (a)  Formulation and approval of plan.--To advance the financial recovery of an assisted

            section 209(j).  (ii)  Reports concerning the debt service requirements on all bonds, notes of the assisted

            as the authority shall determine and shall be issued no later than 60 days prior to
            the beginning of the quarter to which they pertain. The reports shall be updated immediately
            at each issuance of bonds or notes by the assisted city or execution of a lease securing
            bonds of another government agency after the date of the report to reflect any change
            in debt service requirements as a result of the issuance.  (iii)  Any additional information provided by the assisted city concerning changed conditions
            or unexpected events that may affect the assisted city's adherence to the financial
            plan. The reports described in subparagraph (ii) shall be certified by the controller
            of the assisted city.  (2)  Determine, on the basis of information and reports described in paragraph (1), whether
            the assisted city has adhered to the financial plan.  (c)  Variation from the plan.--  (1)  If the authority determines, based upon reports submitted by the assisted city under
            subsection (b) or independent audits, examinations or studies of an assisted city's
            finances obtained under subsection (i)(3), that the assisted city's actual revenues
            and expenditures vary from those estimated in the financial plan, the assisted city
            shall provide additional information as the authority deems necessary to explain the
            variation.  (2)  The authority shall take no action with respect to the assisted city for variations
            from the financial plan in a fiscal quarter if:  (i)  The assisted city provides a written explanation for the variation that the authority
            deems reasonable.  (ii)  The assisted city proposes remedial action that the authority believes will restore
            the assisted city's overall compliance with the financial plan.  (iii)  Information provided by the assisted city in the immediately succeeding quarterly
            financial report demonstrates that the assisted city is taking remedial action and
            otherwise is complying with the financial plan.  (iv)  The assisted city submits monthly supplemental reports in accordance with section
            209(j) until the assisted city regains compliance with the financial plan.  (d)  Authority may make recommendations.--The authority may at any time issue recommendations
            as to how an assisted city may achieve compliance with the financial plan and shall
            provide copies of the recommendations to the chief fiscal officer and the governing
            body of the city and to the officials specified in section 203(b)(4).  (e)  When Commonwealth shall withhold funds.--  (1)  An authority shall certify to the Secretary of the Budget the assisted city's noncompliance
            with the financial plan during any period when the authority has determined that the
            assisted city is not in compliance with the plan and has not taken acceptable remedial
            action during the next quarter following noncompliance with the plan.  (2)  The authority shall certify to the Secretary of the Budget that the assisted city
            is not in compliance with the financial plan if the assisted city:  (i)  has no financial plan approved by the authority, has failed to provide requested documents
            or has failed to file a plan with the authority; or  (ii)  has failed to file mandatory revisions to the financial plan or reports as required
            by section 209(i), (j), (k) or (l).  (3)  (i)  If the authority certifies that an assisted city is not in compliance with the financial
            plan under paragraph (1) or (2), the Secretary of the Budget shall notify the assisted
            city that the certification has been made and that each grant, loan, entitlement or
            payment to the assisted city by the Commonwealth shall be withheld pending compliance
            with the plan.  (ii)  Funds withheld shall be held in escrow by the Commonwealth until compliance with the
            financial plan is restored as specified in paragraph (4).  (iii)  Funds held in escrow under this paragraph shall not lapse under section 621 of the
            act of April 9, 1929 (P.L.177, No.175), known as The Administrative Code of 1929,
            or any other law.  (4)  The authority shall determine when the conditions which caused the assisted city to
            be certified as noncompliant with the financial plan have ceased to exist and shall
            promptly notify the Secretary of the Budget of the vote.  (5)  After receipt of the notice, the Secretary of the Budget shall release all funds held
            in escrow, together with all interest and income earned on the funds during the period
            held in escrow, and the disbursements of amounts in the city account shall resume.  (f)  Exemptions.--Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (e), the following shall
            not be withheld from an assisted city:  (1)  Funds granted or allocated to the assisted city directly from an agency of the Commonwealth

(4)  Funds the assisted city has pledged to repay bonds or notes.  (g)  Effect of Commonwealth's failure to disburse funds.--The provisions of subsection
            (e) shall not apply and an assisted city shall not be found to have departed from
            the financial plan due to the Commonwealth's failure to pay any money, including payment
            of Federal funds distributed by or through the Commonwealth, due to the assisted city
            from money appropriated by the General Assembly.  (h)  Assisted city to determine expenditure of available funds.--Nothing in this act shall
            be construed to limit the power of an assisted city to determine from time to time,
            within available funds of the assisted city, the purposes for which expenditures will
            be made by the assisted city and the amounts of the expenditures then permitted under

            revision to a plan, report or other information required to be filed with the authority
            under this act, the authority, in addition to all other rights that the authority
            may have at law or in equity, may by mandamus compel the assisted city and the officers,
            employees and agents of the assisted city to file with the authority the financial
            plan, revision to a plan, report or other information that the assisted city has failed
            to file.  (2)  The authority shall provide the assisted city written notice of the failure of the
            assisted city to file and of the authority's intention to initiate an action under
            this subsection and shall not initiate the action earlier than 10 days after the giving
            of the notice.  20180124u211s  Section 211.  Investment of funds.  Funds of an authority that are not required for immediate use may be invested in obligations
            of an assisted city or in obligations of the Federal Government or of the Commonwealth

            invested in obligations issued by or obligations guaranteed by the assisted city without
            the approval of the board.  20180124u212s  Section 212.  Sovereign immunity.  No member of the board shall be liable personally for any obligations of the authority.

            immunity reaffirmed; specific waiver) and shall remain immune from suit except as
            provided by and subject to the provisions of 42 Pa.C.S. Ch. 85 (relating to matters
            affecting government units).  20180124u701h    CHAPTER 7  MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS      20180124u701s  Section 701.  Appropriation.  The sum of $100,000 is hereby appropriated from the General Fund to an authority which

            Code of 1971, is amended to read:  Section 401.  Definitions.--The following words, terms, and phrases, when used in this article,
            shall have the meaning ascribed to them in this section, except where the context
            clearly indicates a different meaning:  * * *  (3)  ""Taxable income.""  * * *  2.  In case the entire business of any corporation, other than a corporation engaged in
            doing business as a regulated investment company as defined by the Internal Revenue
            Code of 1986, is not transacted within this Commonwealth, the tax imposed by this
            article shall be based upon such portion of the taxable income of such corporation
            for the fiscal or calendar year, as defined in subclause 1 hereof, and may be determined
            as follows:  * * *  (b)  Railroad, Truck, Bus [or] , Airline or Qualified Air Freight Forwarding Companies.  (1)  All business income of railroad, truck, bus [or] , airline and qualified air freight forwarding companies shall be apportioned to this Commonwealth by multiplying the income by
            a fraction, the numerator of which is the taxpayer's total revenue miles within this
            Commonwealth during the tax period and the denominator of which is the total revenue
            miles of the taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. For purposes of this paragraph
            revenue mile shall mean the average receipts derived from the transportation by the
            taxpayer of persons or property one mile. Where revenue miles are derived from the
            transportation of both persons and property, the revenue mile fractions attributable
            to each such class of transportation shall be computed separately, and the average
            of the two fractions, weighted in accordance with the ratio of total receipts from
            each such class of transportation everywhere to total receipts from both such classes
            of transportation everywhere, shall be used in apportioning income to this Commonwealth.  (2)  Nonbusiness income of railroad, truck, bus [or] , airline and qualified air freight forwarding companies shall be allocated as provided in paragraphs (5) through (8) of phrase
            (a) of subclause 2 of the definition of taxable income.  (3)  As used in this phrase, ""qualified air freight forwarding company"" shall mean a company
            that:  (A)  is engaged in the air freight forwarding business;  (B)  primarily uses an airline with which it has common ownership and control; and  (C)  will use the revenue miles of the airline under subparagraph (B).  * * *  20180131u2s  Section 2.  The amendment of section 401(3)2(b) of the act shall apply to taxable years beginning
            after December 31, 2016.  20180131u3s  Section 3.  This act shall take effect immediately.    APPROVED--The 24th day of October, A.D. 2018.    TOM WOLF   "

            in this State in employment by an employer who is domiciled in another state and who
            has not secured the payment of compensation as required by this act, the [employer

            is entitled to the benefits provided under such law.  In such event:  [(1)  The filing of such certificate shall constitute an appointment by such employer or
            his carrier of the Secretary of Labor and Industry as his agent for acceptance of

            is insured, such employer's carrier, as to such employe or his dependents only, shall
            be deemed to be an insurer authorized to write insurance under and be subject to this
            act: Provided, however, That unless its contract with said employer requires it to
            pay an amount equivalent to the compensation benefits provided by this act, its liability
            for income benefits or medical and related benefits shall not exceed the amounts of
            such benefits for which such insurer would have been liable under the workmen's compensation
            law of such other state[;] .  (4)  If the total amount for which such employer's insurance is liable under clause (3)
            above is less than the total of the compensation benefits to which such employe is
            entitled under this act, the [secretary] department may, if [he deems it] necessary, require the employer to file security[, satisfactory
            to the secretary, to secure] to guarantee the payment of benefits due such employe or his dependents under this act[; and] .  (5)  Upon compliance with the preceding requirements of this subsection (c), such employer,
            as to such employe only, shall be deemed to have secured the payment of compensation
            under this act[.] and shall not be an uninsured employer for purposes of Article XVI.  (c.1)  If an employe alleges an injury that is incurred with an employer which is domiciled
            in another state and which has not secured the payment of compensation as required
            by this act, such employe shall provide to the Uninsured Employers Guaranty Fund,
            and to any workers' compensation judge hearing a petition against the fund, a written
            notice, denial, citation of law or court or administrative ruling from such other
            state or an insurer licensed to write insurance in that state as to that employer,
            indicating that the employe is not entitled to workers' compensation benefits in that
            state. No compensation shall be payable from the Uninsured Employers Guaranty Fund
            until the employe submits the notice, denial, citation or ruling; however, the employe
            may file a notice or petition against the fund under Article XVI prior to the submission.  * * *  20180132u2s  Section 2.  Section 446(a) and (b) of the act are amended and the section is amended by adding

            previous calendar year.  (3)  Each fiscal year, the department shall determine the expenses of the fund for the
            prior fiscal year. If the total amount assessed for the prior fiscal year exceeds
            130% of the expenses for that prior fiscal year, the current fiscal year assessment
            shall be reduced by an amount equal to that excess amount.  * * *  20180132u3s  Section 3.  The act is amended by adding sections to read:  Section 1609.  Uninsured employer obligations.  Nothing in this article shall alter the uninsured employer's obligations under this

            of the insurer, policy period and policy number.  (ii)  No longer operates a business. This subparagraph shall require a statement of the
            dates of operation and cessation of operation.  (iii)  Does not employ an individual entitled to compensation under this act.  (iv)  Is otherwise exempt from the requirements of obtaining insurance under this act. This
            subparagraph shall require the identification of the applicable exemption.  (2)  The employer shall return the form to the department within 15 days of service of

            of:  (A)  the date the employer complies; or  (B)  30 days from service under this paragraph.  (ii)  If an employer does not comply with this paragraph within 45 days of service under
            this paragraph, the department may proceed with further enforcement under subsection
            (d).  (b)  Good cause.--If the department's investigation under section 1605 reveals good cause
            to believe that the employer is required and has failed to insure the employer's liabilities
            as required by this act, the department may proceed with further enforcement under
            subsection (d).  (c)  Enforcement.--For the purposes of enforcing section 305 and this article, each department
            employee or agent charged with enforcement may enter the premises or worksite of an
            employer that is subject to subsection (a)(2)(ii) or (b).  (d)  Stop-work order.--The department may issue an order requiring the cessation of operations
            of an employer that has failed to insure its liabilities as required by this act.
            The following apply:  (1)  The order may require compliance with conditions necessary to ensure that the employer

            or not the mobile home is located in a mobile home park, without being licensed under
            the provisions of this [act] chapter . No mobile home park rule shall prevent the placement of a ""for sale"" sign on the
            home and on the property on which the home is located. Nothing in this paragraph shall
            authorize the listing for sale of preowned mobile homes at a sales lot by a licensed

            seller or manufacturer giving such person buying or selling rights for such new manufactured
            housing.  (ii)  A display, sale, listing or offer for sale from a site or location as permitted by

            and fleet owners.  (2)  Only vehicle dealers licensed under this [act] chapter or by any other state or jurisdiction shall be permitted to purchase vehicles at
            wholesale vehicle auctions. In addition to dealers licensed under this [act] chapter or by any other state or jurisdiction, a vehicle business, except for repair and
            towing, transporter, service, financier or collector/repossessor businesses, registered
            with the Department of Transportation and issued a Department of Transportation identification
            number or licensed or registered by any other state or jurisdiction for a similar
            activity without being licensed under this [act] chapter shall be authorized at wholesale vehicle auctions only to buy, sell or exchange vehicles
            of the type for which the business is authorized to engage by the Department of Transportation
            or any other state or jurisdiction, provided that upon buying such vehicle, application

            or as any other person who would be required to be licensed under this [act] chapter . Any person who has had his license under this [act] chapter or authority to engage as a dealer or salesperson in any other state or jurisdiction

            as salespersons under this [act] chapter . Public or retail vehicle auctions shall inquire of the seller of the vehicle and,
            if applicable, disclose to potential purchasers material information obtained from
            the seller regarding the vehicle being offered for sale as is required of all sellers
            under applicable Federal and Pennsylvania laws.

            precedent to biennial renewal, the license holder shall pay a biennial renewal fee
            and, in the case of a salesperson or manufacturer's or distributor's representative,
            he must be presently employed with a dealer, manufacturer or distributor which has
            a current license. The license holder shall comply with all requirements as set forth
            through regulation by the board.  20180134u8s  Section 8.  Sections 7 and 8 of the act are amended to read:  Section [7] 305 .  Enforcement.  Notwithstanding the enforcement powers granted to law enforcement officers to institute
            summary criminal proceedings pursuant to section [4(b)] 302(b) , the enforcement of the laws and rules and regulations governing practice under this
            act is primarily vested in the board with the following additional powers and duties
            to:  (1)  Inspect all license holders.  (2)  Authorize investigations of alleged violations.  (3)  Review and inspect all business records, documents and files relating to practice
            under this act.  (4)  Subpoena witnesses.  (5)  Take depositions of witnesses in the manner provided for in civil actions in courts

            No.164), known as the Commonwealth Attorneys Act.  (7)  Obtain injunctions from a court of competent jurisdiction against persons acting in
            violation of this act.  Section [8] 306 .  Protest hearing decision within 120 days unless waived by the parties.  (a)  Franchise protest hearings to be decided within 120 days unless waived by the parties.--Any
            franchise establishment, relocation, termination or failure to renew hearing based
            on a protest by a dealer or distributor of any action by a manufacturer or distributor
            alleged to be in violation of a provision of this [act] chapter must be conducted and the final determination made within 120 days after the protest
            is filed. Unless waived by the parties, failure to do so will be deemed the equivalent
            of a determination that the manufacturer or distributor acted with [good] just cause and, in the case of a protest of a proposed establishment or relocation of
            a dealer under section [27] 326 , that [good] just cause does not exist for refusing to permit the proposed additional or relocated
            new vehicle dealer unless such delay is caused by acts of the manufacturer, distributor
            or the additional or relocating dealer. Any parties to such a hearing shall have a
            right of review of the decision in a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to 2
            Pa.C.S. § 701 (relating to scope of subchapter). If the board determined that [good] just cause does not exist for refusing to permit the proposed additional or relocated
            new vehicle dealer and the manufacturer or distributor thereafter enters into a franchise
            establishing that new vehicle dealer, the manufacturer or distributor shall not be
            liable for damages based upon such establishment even if a court reverses the determination
            of the board.  (b)  Procedure.--The procedure at the hearing shall be governed by 1 Pa. Code Pt. II (relating
            to general rules of administrative practice and procedure) with the following exceptions:  (1)  In the event that the protest involves a termination or failure to renew the franchise
            of a new vehicle dealer, the dealer shall be permitted to review a manufacturer's
            or distributor's files related to that dealer upon written request.  (2)  The board may order on its own initiative, or pursuant to a party's request, that
            part of the evidence for hearing be submitted to it in the form of depositions.  (c)  Reconsideration.--In the event a decision of the board is remanded by a court of competent
            jurisdiction for further action by the board, the board shall consider the action
            and issue a final determination, not later than 120 days following receipt of the
            record from such court, unless the 120-day time period for the board to issue a final
            determination is waived or extended by the parties.  (d)  Dealer protest of automobile, motorcycle or truck manufacturer act or omission.--  (1)  Except for protests authorized under section [13 or 27] 312 or 326 and notwithstanding any other remedy available under this [act] chapter , any new vehicle dealer who believes that an automobile, motorcycle or truck manufacturer
            or distributor with whom the new vehicle dealer holds a franchise agreement has violated
            or is violating any provision of this [act] chapter may file a protest with the board setting forth the factual and legal basis for such
            violation.  (2)  The board shall issue a final determination within 120 days after the protest is filed,
            unless the 120-day time period for the board to issue a final determination is waived
            or extended by the parties.  (3)  It shall be the burden of the automobile, motorcycle or truck manufacturer to prove
            it has not violated any provision of this [act] chapter as set forth in the protest filed by the new vehicle dealer.  (4)  The protested action shall not become effective until the final determination is issued
            by the board and shall not be effective thereafter if the board has determined that
            there is [good] just cause for not permitting the protested action.  (5)  The board shall be empowered to direct or require the automobile, motorcycle or truck
            manufacturer or distributor to perform such acts as necessary in order for the manufacturer
            or distributor to comply with the provisions of this [act] chapter .  (e)  Applicability.--The protest provisions of this section apply to Chapter 5 activities
            and actions between recreational vehicle dealers, manufacturers, distributors and
            suppliers.  20180134u9s  Section 9.  Section 9 of the act is renumbered, subsections (a)(4) and (e)(3)(ii) are amended
            and the section is amended by adding a subsection to read:  Section [9] 307 .  Reimbursement for all parts and service required by the manufacturer or distributor;
            reimbursement audits.  (a)  Manufacturers or distributors to notify dealers of their obligations.--  * * *  (4)  This subsection shall not apply to manufacturers or distributors of manufactured housing
            [or recreational vehicles].  * * *  (e)  Warranty reimbursement and incentive or reimbursement program approval and audits.--  * * *  (3)  * * *  (ii)  During the 30-day time period under subparagraph (i), a new vehicle dealer may file
            with the board a protest of the charge-backs as provided for  under section [8] 306 . When such a protest is filed, the board shall inform the manufacturer or distributor
            that a timely protest has been filed and that the manufacturer or distributor shall
            not charge back the new vehicle dealer:  (A)  until the board has held a hearing; or  (B)  if the board has determined that there is good cause for not permitting the charge-back
            of such new vehicle dealer.  * * *  (g)  Applicability.--This section shall not apply to recreational vehicle warrantors or
            dealers.  20180134u10s  Section 10.  Section 9.1 of the act, added June 28, 2018, (P.L.420, No.59), is amended to read:  Section [9.1] 307.1 .  Vehicle recalls.  (a)  General rule.--A manufacturer shall compensate its new vehicle dealers for all labor
            and parts required by the manufacturer to perform recall repairs. Compensation for
            recall repairs shall be in the same manner as warranty parts and labor compensation
            under section [9] 307 . If parts or a remedy are not reasonably available to perform a recall service or
            repair on a used vehicle held for sale by a new vehicle dealer of the same line-make
            within 30 days of the manufacturer issuing the initial notice of recall, and the manufacturer
            has issued a stop-sale order or a do-not-drive order on the vehicle, the manufacturer
            shall compensate the dealer at a prorated rate of at least 1.5% of the value of the
            vehicle per month, beginning on the date that is 30 days after the date on which the
            stop-sale or do-not-drive order was provided to the dealer, until the earlier of the
            date the recall or remedy parts are made available or the date the dealer sells, trades
            or otherwise disposes of the affected used vehicle. The following shall apply:  (1)  The value of a used vehicle shall be the average trade-in value for used vehicles
            as indicated in an independent third-party guide for the year, make, model and mileage
            of the recalled vehicle at the time of the announcement of the stop-sale order or
            the do-not-drive order.  (2)  This section shall only apply to used vehicles subject to safety or emissions recalls
            pursuant to and recalled in accordance with Federal law and regulations and where
            a stop-sale order or a do-not-drive order has been issued. Further, this section shall
            only apply to new vehicle dealers holding used vehicles for sale that are a line-make
            that the dealer is franchised to sell or on which the dealer is authorized to perform
            recall repairs:  (i)  in inventory at the time the stop-sale or do-not-drive order was issued; or  (ii)  which were taken into the used vehicle inventory of the dealer as a lease return vehicle
            or consumer trade-in incident to the purchase of a new vehicle from the dealer after
            the stop-sale or do-not-drive order was issued.  (3)  Nothing in this section shall require a manufacturer to provide total compensation
            to a dealer which would exceed the total average trade-in value of the affected used
            motor vehicle as originally determined under paragraph (1).  (b)  Violation.--It is a violation of this section for a manufacturer to reduce the amount
            of compensation otherwise owed to a new vehicle dealer because the new vehicle dealer
            has submitted a claim for reimbursement under this section or was otherwise compensated
            for a vehicle subject to a recall where a stop-sale order or a do-not-drive order
            has been issued. This subsection applies regardless of whether the reduction in the
            amount of compensation owed to a new vehicle dealer is through a chargeback, removal
            from an incentive program, reduction in amount owed under an incentive program or
            any other means.  (c)  Procedure.--A reimbursement claim made by new vehicle dealers under this section for
            recall remedies or repairs, or for compensation where no part or repair is reasonably
            available and the used vehicle is subject to a stop-sale order or a do-not-drive order,
            shall be subject to the same limitations and requirements as a warranty reimbursement
            claim made under section [9] 307 . A claim shall be either approved or disapproved within 30 days after the claim is
            submitted to the manufacturer in the manner and on the forms the manufacturer reasonably
            prescribes. A claim shall be paid within 30 days of approval of the claim by the manufacturer.
            A claim not specifically disapproved in writing within 30 days after the manufacturer
            receives a submitted claim shall be deemed to be approved.  (d)  Alternative compensation.--As an alternative to the compensation provided for under
            subsection (a):  (1)  a manufacturer may compensate its new vehicle dealers under a national recall compensation
            program if the compensation under the program is equal to or greater than that provided
            under subsection (a); or  (2)  the manufacturer and dealer otherwise agree to equal or greater compensation than
            that provided under subsection (a).  (e)  Exclusive remedy.--Any compensation provided to a new vehicle dealer pursuant to this
            section is exclusive and may not be combined with any other Federal or State recall
            compensation remedy.  (f)  Disclosure.--  (1)  A new or used vehicle dealer shall disclose in writing to used vehicle retail purchasers
            at the time of sale the existence of any open, unremedied recalls. By providing to
            the used vehicle retail purchaser a report obtained from the publicly accessible Internet
            website safercar.gov, or a successor website, based on a vehicle identification number
            search, the dealer shall be deemed to have complied with the disclosure requirement
            under this subsection. For the purpose of this subsection, failure to provide disclosures
            to multiple vehicle retail purchasers at the time of sale in violation of this subsection
            constitutes a single offense with a maximum fine of $1,000 under section [28(a)] 328(a) .  (2)  Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit any civil actions or remedies
            available in statute or common law.  20180134u11s  Section 11.  Sections 10 and 11 of the act are amended to read:  Section [10] 308 .  Damage disclosure.  (a)  Notice to dealer.--Each manufacturer or distributor of new vehicles sold or transferred
            to a new vehicle dealer shall notify the new vehicle dealer in writing prior to delivery
            of the vehicle of any material damage to the vehicle which is known to the manufacturer
            or distributor which was sustained or incurred by the vehicle at any time after the
            manufacturing process is complete but prior to delivery of the vehicle to the dealer.
            A dealer may reject the delivery of a nonconforming vehicle under the provisions of
            13 Pa.C.S. (relating to commercial code).  (b)  Notice to purchaser.--When selling a new vehicle, each new vehicle dealer shall notify
            the purchaser in writing at the time of sale of any material damage sustained or incurred
            by the vehicle at any time after the manufacturing process is complete which is disclosed
            by the manufacturer to the new vehicle dealer.  (c)  Exemption.--This section shall not apply to manufacturers and dealers of manufactured
            housing or to manufacturers, distributors or dealers of motorcycles or  recreational vehicles .  (d)  Other statutes and decisions.--Nothing in this section shall be construed to diminish
            any obligation to provide notice to the purchaser of a new vehicle which obligation
            is imposed by any other provision of law or by any judicial decision, including, but
            not limited to, the act of December 17, 1968 (P.L.1224, No.387), known as the Unfair
            Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law.  Section [11] 309 .  Mediation and arbitration.  (a)  Mediation of disputes between licensees.--  (1)  A dealer or distributor may not file a complaint, petition or protest or bring an
            action in a court of competent jurisdiction against a manufacturer or distributor
            based on an alleged violation of this [act] chapter or in a protest action under this [act] chapter regarding an establishment, relocation or termination of a franchise agreement unless
            the dealer or distributor serves a demand for mediation upon the manufacturer or distributor
            before or contemporaneous with the filing of the complaint, petition or protest or
            the bringing of an action. A demand for mediation shall be in writing and served upon
            the manufacturer or distributor by certified mail at an address designated for that
            manufacturer or distributor within records of the dealer or distributor. The demand
            for mediation shall contain a brief statement of the dispute and the relief sought
            by the dealer or distributor filing the demand.  (2)  Within 20 days after the date a demand for mediation is served, the parties shall
            mutually select an independent mediator and meet with that mediator for the purpose
            of attempting to resolve the dispute. The meeting place shall be in this Commonwealth
            in a location selected by the mediator. The mediator may extend the date of the meeting
            for [good] just cause shown by either party or upon stipulation of both parties.  (3)  The service of a demand for mediation under paragraph (1) shall stay the time for
            the filing of any complaint, petition, protest or action under this [act] chapter until representatives of both parties have met with a mutually selected mediator
            for the purpose of attempting to resolve the dispute. If a complaint, petition, protest
            or action is filed before the meeting, the board or court shall enter an order suspending
            the proceeding or action until the meeting has occurred and may, upon written stipulation
            of all parties to the proceeding or action that they wish to continue to mediate under
            this subsection, enter an order suspending the proceeding or action for as long a
            period as the board or court considers appropriate. A suspension order issued under
            this paragraph may be revoked upon motion of any party or upon motion of the board
            or the court.  (4)  The board shall encourage dealers, manufacturers and distributors to establish, maintain
            and administer a panel of mediators who have the character, ability and training to
            serve as mediators and who have knowledge of the vehicle industry.  (5)  Mandatory mediation under this section shall not be required of any of the following:  (i)  A dealer seeking to dual two or more franchises or a dealer seeking a relocation involving
            a request to dual two or more franchises unless another dealer of the same line-make
            has a right to protest the proposed relocation under section [27] 326 .  (ii)  Manufacturers, distributors or dealers of motorcycles.  (b)  Arbitration of disputes between licensees.--After a dispute arises, the licensees
            may voluntarily agree to submit a dispute arising under this [act] chapter pertaining to a complaint, petition, protest or action to binding or nonbinding arbitration.
            Any arbitration proceeding shall be voluntary, initiated by serving a written demand
            for arbitration on the other party, and shall be conducted under the provisions of
            42 Pa.C.S. Ch. 73 Subch. A (relating to statutory arbitration) and administered by
            representatives of dealers, manufacturers or distributors.  (c)  Immunity and presumption of good faith by mediators and arbitrators.--A mediator or
            arbitrator is immune from civil liability for any good faith act or omission within
            the scope of the mediator's or arbitrator's performance of his powers and duties under
            this section. Every act or omission of a mediator or arbitrator is presumed to be
            a good faith act or omission. This presumption may be overcome only by clear and convincing
            evidence.  20180134u12s  Section 12.  Section 12 of the act, amended June 28, 2018 (P.L.420, No.59), is amended to read:  Section [12] 310 .  Unlawful acts by manufacturers or distributors.  (a)  Unlawful coercive acts.--It shall be a violation for any manufacturer, factory branch,
            distributor, field representative, officer, agent or any representative whatsoever
            of such manufacturer, factory branch or distributor licensed under this [act] chapter to require, attempt to require, coerce or attempt to coerce any new vehicle dealer
            in this Commonwealth to:  (1)  Order or accept delivery of any new vehicle, part or accessory thereof, equipment
            or any other commodity not required by law which shall not have been voluntarily ordered
            by the new vehicle dealer, except that this paragraph is not intended to modify or
            supersede any terms or provisions of the franchise requiring new vehicle dealers to
            market a representative line of those vehicles which the manufacturer or distributor
            is publicly advertising.  (2)  Order or accept delivery of any new vehicle with special features, accessories or
            equipment not included in the list price of such vehicles as publicly advertised by
            the manufacturer or distributor.  (3)  Participate monetarily in an advertising campaign or contest or to purchase unnecessary
            or unreasonable quantities of any promotional materials, training materials, showroom
            or other display decorations or materials at the expense of the new vehicle dealer.  (4)  Enter into any agreement with the manufacturer or to do any other act prejudicial
            to the new vehicle dealer by threatening to terminate or not renew a franchise or
            any contractual agreement existing between the dealer and the manufacturer or distributor,
            except that this paragraph is not intended to preclude the manufacturer or distributor
            from insisting on compliance with the reasonable terms or provisions of the franchise
            or other contractual agreement and notice in good faith to any new vehicle dealer
            of the new vehicle dealer's violation of such terms or provisions shall not constitute
            a violation of [the act] this chapter .  (5)  Change the capital structure of the new vehicle dealer or the means by or through
            which the new vehicle dealer finances the operation of the dealership, provided that
            the new vehicle dealer at all times meets any reasonable capital standards determined
            by the manufacturer or distributor in accordance with uniformly applied criteria,
            and also provided that no change in the capital structure shall cause a change in
            the principal management or have the effect of a sale of the franchise without the
            consent of the manufacturer or distributor. The consent shall be granted or denied
            within 60 days of receipt of a written request from the new vehicle dealer.  (6)  (i)  Refrain from participation in the management   of, investment in or the acquisition of any other line of  new vehicle or related products. This paragraph does not  apply unless the new vehicle dealer maintains a reasonable line of credit for each
            make or line of new vehicle, the new vehicle dealer remains in compliance with the
            reasonable terms of the franchise agreement and any reasonable facilities requirements
            of the manufacturer or distributor, and no change is made in the principal management
            of the new vehicle dealer. The reasonable facilities requirements shall not include
            any requirement that a new vehicle dealer establish or maintain exclusive facilities,
            personnel or display space when such requirements or any of them would be unreasonable
            in light of economic conditions and would not otherwise be justified by reasonable
            business considerations.  (ii)  (A)  Nothing in this paragraph shall permit the dualing or relocation and addition of a
            line-make to the dealership facilities without the new vehicle dealer providing written
            certification to the manufacturer or distributor that the new vehicle dealer, with
            the addition of a line-make by the new  vehicle dealer, will maintain a reasonable line of  credit for each make or line of new vehicle and the new vehicle dealer will remain
            in compliance with the reasonable terms of the franchise agreement and any reasonable
            facilities requirements of the manufacturer or distributor, excluding any exclusive
            facility or nondualing requirements.  (B)  The dealer shall provide the following    information:  (I)  the address of the proposed new location, if applicable;  (II)  a brief description of the proposed facility; and  (III)  the owner of the proposed new location.  (C)  Any objection by the manufacturer or distributor with regard to the dualing or relocation
            and dualing of two or more franchises shall be delivered to the dealer within 45 days
            of receipt of the written certification from the new vehicle dealer. Failure on the
            part of the manufacturer or distributor to timely respond to a dualing or relocation
            and dualing certification shall be deemed to be an approval of the new vehicle dealer's
            certification notice of dualing or relocation and dualing of two or more franchises.
            The manufacturer or distributor shall execute and deliver a franchise reflecting the
            relocated address of the dealership facilities to the new vehicle dealer within 30
            days of the date of the deemed approval.  (iii)  A dealer may file a complaint, petition or protest, or bring an action in a court
            of competent jurisdiction against a manufacturer or distributor, based on a denial
            of a request by a dealer to dual or relocate and dual two or more franchises without
            first going through mediation required under section [11] 309 . If a dualing or relocation and dualing denial protest is filed with the board, a
            hearing shall be held within 45 days of the protest's filing and a final determination
            issued by the board within 90 days of the protest filing. The burden of proof shall
            be on the manufacturer or distributor to show that the dualing or relocation and dualing
            is unreasonable. No automobile, motorcycle or truck manufacturer or distributor may
            limit or restrict the addition of a line-make to the dealership facilities if the
            new vehicle dealer maintains a reasonable line of credit for each make or line of
            new vehicle and the new vehicle dealer remains in compliance with the reasonable terms
            of the franchise agreement and any reasonable facilities requirements of an automobile,
            motorcycle or truck manufacturer or distributor. This paragraph shall also apply if
            the dealer seeks to dual two or more line-makes and no relocation will occur. This
            paragraph shall not impair the rights of another dealer of the same line-make to protest
            a proposed relocation under section [27] 326 .  (7)  Prospectively assent to a release, assignment, novation, waiver or estoppel which
            would relieve any person from liability to be imposed by this [act] chapter or to require any controversy between a new vehicle dealer and a manufacturer, distributor
            or representative to be referred to any person other than the duly constituted courts
            of the Commonwealth or the United States of America, if such referral would be binding
            upon the new vehicle dealer. A dealer and the manufacturer, distributor or representative,
            by themselves or through their respective counsel, are permitted to agree to execute
            a written agreement or to arbitrate in a binding or nonbinding manner after a controversy
            arises.  (8)  Expand, construct or significantly modify facilities before a date that is ten years
            after the date of the construction of the facility or the alteration or remodeling
            at that location was completed and without assurances that the manufacturer or distributor
            will provide a reasonable supply of new vehicles within a reasonable time so as to
            justify such an expansion in light of the market and economic conditions. This paragraph
            shall not apply if the expansion, construction or significant modification is necessary
            to comply with a health or safety law or to comply with a technology requirement,
            which is necessary to sell or service a vehicle that the new vehicle dealer is licensed
            by the manufacturer to sell or service. This section shall apply to any successor
            dealer provided the dealer has been designated and approved by the manufacturer in
            the franchise agreement and the construction, alteration or remodeling substantially
            complied with the manufacturer's brand image standards or plans that the manufacturer
            provided at the time the construction, alteration or remodeling was completed. Nothing
            in this paragraph shall prohibit a manufacturer from:  (i)  Continuing a facility improvement program that is in effect as of the effective date
            of this subparagraph with more than one new vehicle dealer in this Commonwealth or
            to renewing or modifying the facility improvement program.  (ii)  Providing lump sum or regularly scheduled payments to assist a new vehicle dealer
            in making a facility improvement, including construction, alteration or remodeling
            or installing signage or an image element.  (iii)  Providing reimbursement to a new vehicle dealer on reasonable, written terms for a
            portion of the new vehicle dealer's cost of making a facility improvement, including
            construction, alteration or remodeling, the purchase of goods, building materials
            or services or installing signage or an image element.  (8.1)  Unreasonably expand, construct or significantly modify facilities in light of the
            market and economic conditions or require a separate facility for the sale or service
            of a line-make of a new vehicle if the market and economic conditions do not clearly
            justify the separate facility.  (8.2)  (i)  Purchase a good or service from a vendor selected, identified or designated by a manufacturer,
            factory branch, distributor, distributor branch or an affiliate of a manufacturer,
            factory branch, distributor, distributor branch by agreement, program, incentive provision
            or other method if expanding, constructing or significantly modifying a facility without
            allowing the dealer the option to obtain a good or service of substantially similar
            quality from a vendor chosen by the dealer and approved by the manufacturer, which
            approval may not be unreasonably withheld.  (ii)  Nothing under this paragraph shall be construed to:  (A)  Allow a dealer or vendor to eliminate or impair a manufacturer's intellectual property
            rights, including a manufacturer's intellectual property rights in a trademark.  (B)  Permit a dealer to erect or maintain signs that do not conform to the intellectual
            property usage guidelines of the manufacturer.  (9)  Agree as a condition to granting or renewing a franchise to waive, limit or disclaim
            a right that the dealer may have to protest the establishment or relocation of another
            vehicle dealer in the relevant market area as provided in section [27] 326 , unless such agreement is voluntary.  (10)  (i)  Sell, offer to sell or sell exclusively an extended service contract, extended maintenance
            plan or similar product, such as gap products, offered, endorsed or sponsored by the
            manufacturer or distributor by the following means:  (A)  By an act or statement that the manufacturer or distributor will in any manner impact
            the dealer, whether it is express or implied or made directly or indirectly.  (B)  By a contract, or an express or implied offer of contract, made to the dealer on the
            condition that the dealer shall sell, offer to sell or sell exclusively an extended
            service contract, extended maintenance plan or similar product offered,  endorsed or sponsored by the manufacturer or distributor.  (C)  By measuring the dealer's performance under the franchise based on the sale of extended
            service contracts, extended maintenance plans or similar products offered, endorsed
            or sponsored by the manufacturer or distributor.  (D)  By requiring the dealer to actively promote the sale of extended service contracts,
            extended maintenance plans or similar products offered, endorsed or sponsored by the
            manufacturer or distributor.  (ii)  Nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit a manufacturer or distributor from providing
            incentive programs to a new vehicle dealer who makes the voluntary decision to offer
            to sell, sell or sell exclusively an extended service contract, extended maintenance
            plan or similar product offered, endorsed or sponsored by the manufacturer or distributor.  (b)  Violations.--It shall be a violation of this [act] chapter for any manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, field representative, officer,
            agent or any representative whatsoever of such manufacturer, factory branch or distributor
            licensed under this [act] chapter to:  (1)  Delay, refuse or fail to deliver new vehicles or new vehicle parts or accessories
            in a reasonable time and in reasonable quantity relative to the new vehicle dealer's
            facilities and sales potential after acceptance of an order from a new vehicle dealer
            having a franchise for the retail sale of any new vehicle sold or distributed of an
            order from a new vehicle dealer having a franchise for the retail sale of any new
            vehicle sold or distributed by the manufacturer or distributor as are covered by such
            franchise, if such vehicle, parts or accessories are publicly advertised as being
            available for immediate delivery. There is no violation if the failure is caused by
            acts or causes beyond the control of the manufacturer or distributor.  (2)  Unfairly discriminate among its new vehicle dealers with respect to warranty, recall,
            service contract or any other service required by the manufacturer or distributor
            with regard to labor or parts reimbursement.  (3)  Unreasonably withhold consent to the sale, transfer or exchange of the franchise to
            a qualified buyer capable of being licensed as a new vehicle dealer in this Commonwealth
            who meets the manufacturer's or distributor's reasonable requirements for appointment
            as a dealer.  (4)  Unreasonably withhold consent to the relocation of an existing new vehicle dealer.
            If the relocation involves dualing of two or more franchises, the requirements of
            subsection (a)(6)(ii) and (iii) shall apply and paragraph (5) shall not apply.  (5)  Fail to respond in writing to a request for consent as specified in paragraphs (3)
            and (4) within 60 days of receipt of a written request on the forms, if any, generally
            utilized by the manufacturer or distributor for such purposes and containing the information
            required. The failure to respond within the time period set forth in this paragraph
            shall be deemed to be approval of the request, and the manufacturer or distributor
            shall execute and deliver a franchise to the applicant within 30 days of the expiration
            of this time period. A manufacturer or distributor shall acknowledge in writing to
            the applicant the receipt of the forms, and, if the manufacturer or distributor requires
            additional information to complete its review, the manufacturer or distributor shall
            notify the applicant within 15 days of the receipt of the forms. If the manufacturer
            or distributor fails to request additional information from the applicant within 15
            days after receipt of the initial forms, the 60-day time period for approval shall
            be deemed to run from the initial receipt date. Otherwise, the 60-day time period
            for approval shall run from receipt of the supplemental requested information. In
            no event shall the total time period for approval exceed 75 days from the date of
            the receipt of the initial forms.  (6)  Prevent or attempt to prevent by contract or otherwise, any new vehicle dealer from
            changing the executive management control of the new vehicle dealer unless the manufacturer
            or distributor, having the burden of proof, can show that such change of executive
            management will result in executive management or control by a person or persons who
            are not of good moral character or who do not meet reasonable, preexisting, and, with
            consideration given to the volume of sales and service of the dealership, uniformly
            applied minimum business experience standards. Where the manufacturer or distributor
            rejects a proposed change in executive management control, the manufacturer or distributor
            shall give written notice of its reasons to the dealer within 60 days of notice to
            the manufacturer by the dealer of the proposed change; otherwise the change in the
            executive management of the new vehicle dealer shall be presumptively deemed approved.  (7)  Offer in connection with a sale of a new vehicle or vehicles to the Federal Government,
            the Commonwealth or any political subdivision thereof, any discounts, refunds or any
            other type of inducement to any new vehicle dealer without making the same offer or
            offers available to all other of its new vehicle dealers within this Commonwealth.
            This paragraph shall not be construed to prevent the offering of incentive programs
            or other discounts if the discounts are equally available to all franchised vehicle
            dealers in this Commonwealth on a proportionally equal basis.  (8)  Fail to indemnify its franchised dealers, notwithstanding the terms of any franchise
            agreement, against any judgment for damages or settlement approved in writing by the
            manufacturer or distributor, including, but not limited to, court costs and reasonable
            attorney fees of the new vehicle dealer, arising out of complaints, claims or lawsuits,
            including, but not limited to, strict liability, negligence, misrepresentation, express
            or implied warranty or rescission of the sale as defined in 13 Pa.C.S. § 2608 (relating
            to revocation of acceptance in whole or in part) to the extent that the judgment or
            settlement relates solely to the alleged defective or negligent functions by the manufacturer
            or distributor beyond the control of the dealer.  (9)  Sell or exchange with a second or final stage manufacturer, retail consumer or end
            user except through a licensed new vehicle dealer. This paragraph shall not apply
            to manufacturer or distributor sales of new vehicles to the Federal Government, charitable
            organizations and employees of the manufacturer.  (10)  [(i)]  Modify a franchise during the term of the franchise or upon its renewal if the modification
            substantially and adversely affects the new vehicle dealer's rights, obligations,
            investment or return on investment without giving 60 days' written notice of the proposed
            modification to the new vehicle dealer unless the modification is required by law,
            court order or the board. Within the 60-day notice period, the new vehicle dealer
            may file with the board and serve notice upon the manufacturer or distributor a protest
            requesting a determination of whether there is [good] just cause for permitting the proposed modification. The board shall promptly schedule
            a hearing and decide the matter within 180 days from the date the protest is filed.
            Multiple protests pertaining to the same proposed modification shall be consolidated
            for hearing. The proposed modification shall not take effect pending the determination
            of the matter. In determining whether there is [good] just cause for permitting a proposed modification, the board shall consider any relevant
            factors, including, but not limited to:  [(A)] (i) The reasons for the proposed modification.  [(B)] (ii) Whether the proposed modification is applied to or affects all new vehicle dealers
            in a      nondiscriminatory manner.  [(C)] (iii) Whether the proposed modification will have a substantial and adverse effect upon
            the new vehicle dealer's investment or return on investment.  [(D)] (iv) Whether the proposed modification is in the public interest.  [(E)] (v) Whether the proposed modification is necessary to the orderly and profitable distribution
            of products by the manufacturer or distributor.  [(F)] (vi) Whether the proposed modification is offset by other modifications beneficial to the
            new vehicle dealer.  [(ii)  This paragraph shall not apply to recreational vehicle manufacturers, distributors
            or dealers.]  (11)  Fail or refuse to offer to its new vehicle dealers all new model vehicles manufactured
            for that line-make franchise or require any of its new vehicle dealers to pay an unreasonable
            fee, unreasonably remodel or renovate the new vehicle dealer's existing facilities,
            unreasonably purchase or construct a new facility, unreasonably purchase parts, supplies,
            tools, equipment, operational services, other merchandise or unreasonably participate
            in training programs in order to receive any new model vehicles, parts or accessories.
            It shall not be a violation of this paragraph if the manufacturer or distributor fails
            to supply new vehicle dealers with model vehicles, parts or accessories due to circumstances
            beyond the control of the manufacturer or distributor, including, but not limited
            to, strike or labor difficulty, shortage of materials, freight embargo or temporary
            lack of capacity.  (12)  Operate a system for the allocation of new vehicles which is not reasonable or fair
            to a new vehicle dealer. Upon the written request of any of its new vehicle dealers,
            a manufacturer or distributor shall disclose to the new vehicle dealer the method
            on which new vehicles are allocated among the new vehicle dealers of the same line-make.
            The manufacturer distributor has the burden of establishing the fairness of its allocation.  (13)  Own, operate or control, either directly or indirectly, any vehicle warranty facility.
            Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit any manufacturer or distributor from owning,
            operating or controlling any warranty facility for warranty repairs on vehicles owned
            or operated by the manufacturer or distributor.  (14)  Compel a dealer through a finance subsidiary of the manufacturer or distributor to
            agree to unreasonable operating requirements or to directly or indirectly terminate
            a new vehicle dealer through the actions of a finance subsidiary of the manufacturer
            or distributor. This paragraph shall not limit the right of a financing entity to
            engage in business practices in accordance with the trade of retail or wholesale vehicle
            financing.  (15)  Use any subsidiary corporation, affiliated corporation or any other controlled corporation,
            partnership, association, entity or person to accomplish what would otherwise be illegal
            conduct under this [act] chapter on the part of the manufacturer or distributor.  (16)  Release to any third party any customer information which has been provided by the
            new vehicle dealer to the manufacturer or distributor if the customer objects in writing
            to releasing the information, unless the information is necessary for the manufacturer
            or distributor to meet its obligations to customers or new vehicle dealers under requirements
            imposed by Federal or State law.  (17)  Require or coerce or attempt to require or coerce a new vehicle dealer to pay attorney
            fees of the manufacturer or distributor related to hearings and appeals brought under
            this [act] chapter .  (18)  Vary the price charged to any of its new vehicle dealers, which has the effect of
            causing a difference in the price of any similarly equipped new vehicle to its new
            vehicle dealers or to the ultimate purchaser. This paragraph shall not be construed
            to prevent the offering of incentive programs or other discounts if the incentive
            or discounts are available to all competing new vehicle dealers of the same line-make
            in this Commonwealth on a proportionately equal basis.  (19)  Directly or indirectly condition any of the following actions on a dealer, prospective
            dealer or owner of an interest in a dealership franchise or facility to enter into
            a site-control agreement or exclusive use agreement:  (i)  awarding of a franchise to a prospective dealer;  (ii)  adding of a line-make or franchise to an existing dealer's franchise or facility;  (iii)  renewing of an existing dealer's franchise;  (iv)  approving of the relocation of an existing dealer's franchise or facility; or  (v)  approving of the sale or transfer of a dealer's ownership of a franchise or facility.  Nothing in this paragraph prohibits a dealer, prospective dealer or owner of an interest
            in a dealership franchise or facility from voluntarily entering into such an agreement
            for other consideration. However, a provision contained in an agreement which is not
            voluntarily entered into by a dealer, prospective dealer or owner of an interest in
            a dealership franchise or facility on or after the effective date of this paragraph
            that is inconsistent with the provisions of this section shall be a violation of this
            [act] chapter .  (c)  Restriction on ownership of dealer.--  (1)  Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a manufacturer or distributor shall
            not:  (i)  own or hold an interest, other than a passive, minority interest in a publicly traded
            dealer held for investment purposes, in a dealer licensed under this [act] chapter which is engaging in the business of buying, selling or exchanging vehicles; or  (ii)  operate or control a dealer licensed under this [act] chapter which is engaging in the business of buying, selling or exchanging vehicles.  (2)  A manufacturer or distributor may own or hold an interest in a dealer or otherwise
            operate or control a dealer for a period not to exceed 12 months from the date the
            manufacturer or distributor acquires an interest in the dealer if:  (i)  The person from whom the manufacturer or distributor acquired the dealer was a franchised
            dealer.  (ii)  The dealer is for sale by the manufacturer or distributor at a reasonable price and
            on reasonable terms and conditions.  (3)  On a showing by a manufacturer or distributor of [good] just cause, the board may extend the time limit set forth in paragraph (2). An extension
            under this paragraph may not exceed 12 months. Where an extension under this paragraph
            is sought, the manufacturer or distributor shall provide notice delivered 30 days
            before the extension request is filed with the board to all the same line-make dealers
            within a ten-mile radius of the manufacturer or distributor owned, operated or controlled
            dealer. An application for an extension is subject to protest by a dealer of the same
            line-make who is within the ten-mile radius of the manufacturer or distributor owned,
            operated or controlled dealer.  (4)  For the primary purpose of broadening the diversity of its dealer body and enhancing
            opportunities for qualified persons who are part of a group who have historically
            been underrepresented in its dealer body or other qualified persons who lack the resources
            to purchase a dealer outright, a manufacturer or distributor may temporarily own an
            interest in a dealer if the manufacturer's or distributor's participation in the dealer
            is in a bona fide relationship with a franchised dealer who:  (i)  At or prior to the time the prospective dealer takes an equity interest in the dealer,
            the prospective dealer is obligated to make a significant investment in the dealer,
            subject to loss.  (ii)  Has an ownership interest in the dealer.  (iii)  Operates the dealer under a written agreement to acquire full ownership of the dealer
            within a reasonable time and under reasonable terms and conditions.  (5)  A manufacturer or distributor shall not unfairly discriminate or compete in terms
            of any sales, service or operational activities with a new vehicle dealer of the same
            line-make when a manufacturer or distributor operates a new vehicle dealer under this
            subsection.  (6)  The following shall apply:  (i)  A manufacturer or distributor may own, operate or control not more than five new vehicle
            dealerships trading solely in electric vehicles, as defined in 75 Pa.C.S. § 102 (relating
            to definitions), that are not sold as new vehicles by a licensed independent new vehicle
            dealer pursuant to an existing franchise with a manufacturer or distributor, if each
            of the following conditions are met:  (A)  Each of the new vehicle dealerships selling the manufacturer's new motor vehicles
            in this Commonwealth trade exclusively in the manufacturer's line-make.  (B)  Each of the new vehicle dealerships selling the manufacturer's motor vehicles in this
            Commonwealth are determined to be in compliance with this [act] chapter .  (C)  Either of the following apply:  (I)  The manufacturer, distributor or a subsidiary, affiliate or controlled entity has
            not acquired, nor does it hold a controlling interest in another manufacturer or distributor,
            required to be licensed under this [act] chapter .  (II)  If a controlling interest is acquired, the manufacturer, distributor or a subsidiary,
            affiliate or controlled entity may not continue to operate or control a new vehicle
            dealership under this subsection for a period not more than 12 months from the date
            it acquired the controlling interest.  (D)  Either of the following apply:  (I)  A controlling interest in the original manufacturer, distributor or any subsidiary,
            affiliate or controlled entity was not transferred, sold or conveyed to another manufacturer,
            distributor, person or entity required to be licensed under this [act] chapter .  (II)  If a controlling interest is transferred, sold or conveyed to another manufacturer,
            distributor, person or entity required to be licensed under this [act] chapter , the entity may not continue to operate or control a new vehicle dealership under
            this subsection for a period not more than 12 months from the date it acquired the
            controlling interest.  (E)  The manufacturer shall have continuously offered electric vehicles for sale for a
            period of not less than 12 months prior to the effective date of this clause.  (ii)  Nothing under this [act] chapter shall prohibit a manufacturer operating or controlling a new vehicle dealership under
            this paragraph from owning, operating or controlling a warranty facility for warranty
            repairs on the manufacturer's line-make of vehicles.  (7)  Nothing under this subsection shall prohibit the sale or lease of used vehicles obtained
            as a result of a trade or return of a vehicle during the purchase of a new vehicle
            under paragraph (6) at a manufacturer's licensed location.  (d)  Applicability.--  (1)  Subsections (b)(11) through (17) and (c) shall not apply to manufacturers, distributors
            or dealers of manufactured housing [or recreational vehicles].  (1.1)  This section shall not apply to manufacturers, distributors or dealers of recreational
            vehicles.  (2)  Subsections (b)(13) and (15) and (c) shall not apply to the ownership or activities
            of a manufacturer in the operation of a licensed dealer or a licensed dealer that
            fulfills the following conditions:  (i)  The manufacturer maintains an ownership interest in, operates or controls a licensed
            dealer whose primary business purpose is the rental of vehicles.  (ii)  Vehicles sold by the licensed dealer primarily engaged in the business of rental vehicles
            are limited to those vehicles used for rental purposes or vehicles obtained in trade
            for such vehicles.  (iii)  Any warranty repairs are limited to those repairs conducted on the vehicles used in
            the vehicle rental business or vehicles sold by the licensed dealer.  20180134u13s  Section 13.  Sections 12.1, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19 of the act are amended to read:  Section [12.1] 311 .  Area of responsibility.  (a)  General rule.-- It shall be a violation of this [act] chapter for any manufacturer or distributor, officer, agent or any representative of a manufacturer
            or distributor to unreasonably alter a new vehicle dealer's area of responsibility.
            The following shall apply:  (1)  Advance notice from the manufacturer of an alteration of a dealer's area of responsibility
            shall be given at least 60 days before the effective date of the alteration. The notice
            shall include an explanation of the basis for the alteration.  (2)  At any time before the effective date of such alteration of a dealer's area of responsibility,
            and after the completion of any internal appeal process pursuant to the manufacturer's
            or distributor's policy manual, the dealer may file a protest as provided for under
            section [8] 306 . In the event a protest is filed, no such alteration of a dealer's area of responsibility
            shall become effective until final determination by the board.  (3)  If a dealer protests under paragraph (2), the burden of proof shall be on the manufacturer
            to show that the dealer's area of responsibility is reasonable and justifiable in
            light of the market conditions.  (4)  If a new vehicle dealer's area of responsibility is altered, the manufacturer shall
            allow 18 months for the dealer to penetrate the market and to become sales effective
            prior to taking negative legal action claiming a breach or nonperformance of the dealer's
            sales performance responsibilities against the dealer.  (b)  Exception.--This section shall not apply to recreational vehicle manufacturers, distributors
            or dealers.  Section [13] 312 .  Termination of franchises.  (a)  Terminations.--It shall be a violation of this [act] chapter for any manufacturer or distributor, officer, agent or any representative whatsoever
            to unfairly, without due regard to the equities of said dealer and without just cause,
            terminate or fail to renew the franchise of any vehicle dealer; or being a manufacturer,
            to unfairly, without due regard to the equities of a distributor and without just
            cause, terminate or fail to renew the franchise of any distributor. The manufacturer
            or distributor shall not meet its burden of proof to terminate or fail to renew the
            franchise if the acts of the manufacturer or distributor, in whole or in significant
            part, caused the dealer or distributor to be unable to comply substantially with the
            reasonable and material requirements of the franchise.  (b)  Mutual agreement of termination filing.--All existing dealers' franchises shall continue
            in full force and operation under a newly appointed distributor on the termination
            of an existing distributor unless a mutual agreement of termination is filed with
            the board between the newly appointed distributor and such dealer.  (c)  Notification of termination.--Not less than 60 days advance notice of such termination
            or failure to renew shall be given the dealer or distributor prior to the effective
            date thereof unless the nature or character of the reason for termination or failure
            to renew is such that the giving of such notice would not be in the public interest.
            A copy of the notice shall also be provided to the board.  (1)  The 60-day notice period required by this subsection may be reduced to not less than
            15 consecutive business days if the ground for termination or failure to renew is:  (i)  insolvency of the dealer or filing of any petition by or against the dealer under
            any bankruptcy or receivership law;  (ii)  failure of the dealer to conduct customary sales and service operations during business
            hours for seven consecutive business days, except in circumstances beyond the direct
            control of the dealer;  (iii)  conviction of the dealer, or any owner thereof, of any felony which is punishable
            by imprisonment;  (iv)  suspension or revocation of any license which the new vehicle dealer is required to
            have to operate a dealership; or  (v)  based on a determination that there was a fraudulent misrepresentation by the dealer
            to the manufacturer or distributor which is material to the franchise.  (2)  The 60-day notice period under this subsection is not required if the new vehicle
            dealer or distributor waives it voluntarily in writing.  (d)  Appeals.--At any time before the effective date of such termination or failure to
            renew, the dealer or distributor may appeal to the board for a hearing on the merits,
            and following due notice to all parties concerned, such hearing shall be promptly
            held. No such termination or failure to renew shall become effective until final determination
            of the issue by the board.  (e)  Burden of proof and just cause terminations on appeal.--In the event of a dealer or
            distributor appeal of the termination or failure to renew of its franchise, the burden
            of proof shall be on the manufacturer or distributor to show that such termination
            or failure to renew was for just cause. Any termination or failure to renew which
            is subject to section [14] 313 shall not be subject to this subsection.  (f)  Exception.--This section shall not apply to recreational vehicle manufacturers, distributors
            or dealers.  Section [14] 313 .  Industry reorganization.  (a)  Violation.--  (1)  It shall be a violation of this [act] chapter for a manufacturer or distributor directly or indirectly or through any officer,
            agent or employee to terminate or fail to renew a franchise of a new vehicle dealer
            in connection with:  (i)  any change in ownership or control of all or any part of the manufacturer's or distributor's
            business whether by sale or transfer of assets, corporate stock or other equity interest;
            assignment; merger; consolidation; combination; joint venture; redemption; operation
            of law; or otherwise; or  (ii)  the termination, suspension or cessation of all or any part of the manufacturer's
            or distributor's business operations except for a termination of a part of the manufacturer's
            or distributor's business operations throughout the United States that is not otherwise
            part of any change in ownership or control of the manufacturer's or distributor's
            business.  (2)  Paragraph (1) shall not apply if:  (i)  a manufacturer or distributor offers a dealer a replacement franchise with reasonable
            terms or conditions; or  (ii)  the manufacturer or distributor, within 90 days of the effective date of the termination
            or failure to renew, compensates the dealer in an amount at least equivalent to the
            higher of the fair market value of the franchise or portion of the franchise terminated
            or failed to be renewed on the date the manufacturer or distributor announces the
            act that results in the termination or nonrenewal of the franchise or the date on
            which the notice of termination or nonrenewal of the franchise is issued.  (3)  If the manufacturer or distributor either or both:  (i)  authorizes the dealer to continue servicing and supplying parts, including warranty
            service and parts, for any goods or services marketed by the dealer pursuant to the
            franchise for a period of not less than five years from the effective date of the
            termination or failure to renew and continues to reimburse the dealer for warranty
            parts and service at the same prices and terms as franchised dealers for the manufacturer
            or distributor;  (ii)  continues to supply the dealer with replacement parts for any goods or services marketed
            by the dealer pursuant to the franchise for a period of not less than five years from
            the effective date of the termination or failure to renew at the same prices and terms
            as franchised dealers for the manufacturer or distributor;  and if a dealer chooses to continue either or both such parts and service operation
            under subparagraph (i) or (ii), the fair market value compensation of the franchise
            shall be reduced to reflect the value of continuing either or both such parts and
            service operation.  (b)  Acts affecting franchise.--For purposes of subsection (a), the termination or discontinuation
            of a series, line, brand or class of new vehicle marketed by a manufacturer or distributor
            as a distinct series, line, brand or class shall be deemed to be the termination or
            nonrenewal of a franchise even if said series, line, brand or class of new vehicle
            is part of a franchise including other series, lines, brands or classes of new vehicle,
            provided that nothing in this subsection shall be construed as prohibiting a manufacturer
            or distributor from changing, adding or deleting models, specifications, model names,
            numbers or identifying marks or similar characteristics of the new vehicles it markets,
            provided that such change, addition or deletion does not result in the termination
            or discontinuance of a distinct series, line, brand or class of new vehicle.  (c)  Disputes.--Any dispute arising between a manufacturer or distributor and a dealer
            under this section involving the determination of the fair market valuation of a franchise
            shall be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by the board.  (d)  Exemption.--This section shall not apply to motorcycle or recreational vehicle manufacturers,
            distributors or dealers.  Section [15] 314 .  Succession to franchise ownership.  (a)  Succession of ownership interest.--Notwithstanding the terms of any franchise, any
            owner of a new vehicle dealership may appoint, by will or any other written instrument,
            a designated family member, the spouse, child or grandchild, spouse of a child or
            grandchild, brother, sister or parent of the dealer owner, or qualified manager, who
            has been employed at the dealership for at least two years, to succeed to the ownership
            interest of such owner in the new vehicle dealership.  (b)  Consent to succession on part of manufacturer or distributor.--Notwithstanding the
            terms of any franchise, unless there exists [good] just cause to withhold consent to succession on the part of the manufacturer or distributor,
            any designated family member or qualified manager of the franchise location in question
            of a retiring, deceased or incapacitated owner of a new vehicle dealership may succeed
            to the ownership interest of such owner under the existing franchise, provided:  (1)  The designated family member or qualified manager furnishes written notice to the
            manufacturer or distributor of his or her intention to succeed to the ownership of
            the new vehicle dealership within 60 days after the owner's retirement, death or incapacity.  (2)  The designated family member or qualified manager agrees to be bound by all then existing
            terms and conditions of the franchise.  (c)  Submission of personal and financial information.--The manufacturer or distributor
            may request, and the designated family member or qualified manager shall promptly
            provide, such personal and financial information as is reasonably necessary to determine
            whether the succession will be honored.  (d)  Withholding consent to succession.--If a manufacturer or distributor believes that
            [good] just cause exists to withhold consent to the succession to the ownership of a new vehicle
            dealership by a designated family member or qualified manager of a retiring, deceased
            or incapacitated owner of a new vehicle dealership under the existing franchise, the
            manufacturer or distributor must serve written notice on the designated family member
            or qualified manager and on the board of its refusal to honor the succession and intent
            to discontinue the existing franchise with the new vehicle dealer. Such notice shall
            be served no later than 60 days after the manufacturer's or distributor's receipt
            of:  (1)  notice of the designated family member's or qualified manager's intent to succeed
            to the ownership of the new vehicle dealer; or  (2)  any personal or financial information requested by the manufacturer or distributor.  (e)  Notice requirements.--The notice in subsection (d) shall state the specific grounds
            to withhold consent to honor the succession and the manufacturer's or distributor's
            intent to discontinue the franchise with the new vehicle dealer no sooner than 60
            days after the date the notice is served. The reasons given for the disapproval or
            any explanation of those reasons by the manufacturer or distributor shall not subject
            the manufacturer or distributor to any civil liabilities unless the reasons given
            or explanations made are malicious and published with the sole intent to cause harm
            to the dealer or successor. If the notice of refusal and discontinuance is not timely
            and properly served, the franchise shall continue in effect, subject to termination
            only as otherwise provided under this [act] chapter .  (f)  Protest requirements upon withholding of consent.--Within 30 days after receipt of
            such notice or within 30 days after the end of any appeal procedure provided by the
            manufacturer or distributor, whichever is greater, the designated family member or
            qualified manager may file with the board to protest the withholding the consent to
            honor the succession. When a protest is filed, the board shall promptly notify the
            manufacturer or distributor that a timely protest has been filed and that such manufacturer
            or distributor shall not terminate or discontinue the existing franchise until the
            board has held a hearing and issued a written decision within 120 days of the filing
            of the protest nor thereafter, unless the board determines that there is [good] just cause for not permitting the succession.  (g)  Conflicts.--This [act] chapter shall not preclude the owner of a new vehicle dealership from designating any person
            as his or her successor by written instrument filed with the manufacturer or distributor.
            In the event of any conflict between such a written instrument which has not been
            revoked by written notice from the owner to the manufacturer or distributor, and this
            section, the written instrument shall govern.  (h)  Restriction.--This section shall not apply if the successor will not agree to comply

            change of all or substantially all ownership or transfer of all or substantially all
            dealership assets if all of the following requirements are met:  (1)  To exercise its right of first refusal, the manufacturer or distributor must notify

            section [12(b)(5)] 310(b)(5) .  (2)  The exercise of the right of first refusal will result in the dealer and dealer's
            owners receiving the same or greater consideration as they have contracted to receive
            in connection with the proposed change of all or substantially all ownership or transfer
            of all or substantially all dealership assets. In that regard, the following shall

            provided that the manufacturer or distributor has knowledge of such obligations at
            the time of the exercise of the right of first refusal. Failure by an assignee of
            the manufacturer or distributor to discharge such obligations shall be deemed a failure
            by the manufacturer or distributor under this subsection.  (3)  The proposed change of all or substantially all ownership or transfer of all or substantially
            all dealership assets does not involve the transfer of assets or the transfer or issuance

            in negotiating and implementing the contract for the proposed change of all or substantially
            all ownership or transfer of all or substantially all dealership assets. Notwithstanding
            the foregoing, no payment of such expenses and attorney fees shall be required if

            request for such an accounting. Such an accounting may be requested by a manufacturer
            or distributor before exercising its right of first refusal.  (b)  Exception.--This section shall not apply to recreational vehicle manufacturers, distributors

            is honest, trustworthy and of good repute and recommending that a license be granted.
            In the case of an applicant who is himself a dealer, an officer of a corporation which
            is a dealer or a member of a partnership which is a dealer, the foregoing recommendation

            reasonable information as the board shall require.  (c)  Application for license other than as a dealer, vehicle auction or salesperson.--Application
            for license other than as a dealer, vehicle auction or salesperson shall be made in

            application or otherwise, information relating to the applicant's background and his
            financial standing, all of which may be considered by the board in determining the
            fitness of said applicant to engage in the business for which he desires to be licensed.  (d)  Manufacturer's or distributor's license.--Application for license as a manufacturer
            or distributor shall be made in writing to the board, signed by the applicant, setting

            the licensee to submit to the entire license application process as set forth by this
            act or corresponding regulations.  20180134u17s  Section 17.  Sections 23, 24, 25 and 26 of the act are renumbered to read:  Section [23] 322 .  Refusal of license.  The board may refuse to issue a license if the applicant has committed any of the
            acts set forth as grounds for the suspension or revocation of a license or the board
            finds that the applicant continued to engage in an activity in violation of this act
            during the suspension or revocation period. The board may also refuse to issue a license
            when it determines:  (1)  That the applicant was previously the holder of a license issued under this act, which
            license was revoked for cause or which license was suspended for cause and the terms
            of the suspension have not been fulfilled.  (2)  That the applicant was previously a limited or general partner, stockholder, director
            or officer of a partnership or corporation whose license issued under the authority
            of this act was revoked for cause and never reissued or was suspended for cause and
            the terms of suspension have not been fulfilled.  (3)  If the applicant is a partnership or corporation, that one or more of the limited
            or general partners, stockholders, directors or officers of the partnership or corporation
            was previously the holder of a license issued under the authority of this act which
            was revoked for cause or was suspended for cause and the terms of the suspension have
            not been fulfilled, or that by reason of the facts and circumstances touching the
            organization, control and management of the partnership or corporation business, the
            policy of such business will be directed, controlled or managed by individuals who,
            by reason of their conviction of violations of the provisions of this act, would be
            ineligible for a license and that by licensing such corporation or partnership, the
            purposes of this act would likely be defeated.  (4)  That the applicant is a vehicle dealer, vehicle auction or salesperson who, having
            within five years prior to the application for or issuance of a license or while a
            current license is in force, pleaded guilty, entered a plea of nolo contendere or
            has been found guilty in a court of competent jurisdiction in Federal or in this or
            any other state jurisdiction of forgery, embezzlement, obtaining money under false

            crime involving moral turpitude.  Section [24] 323 .  Change of salesperson's license to indicate new employer.  Whenever a licensed salesperson desires to change his employment from one licensed
            dealer to another, he shall notify the board in writing using the appropriate form,
            which is completed in its entirety and is accurate, no later than ten days after the
            date of change, pay the required fee and return the current license if not previously
            returned. The board shall issue a new license upon receipt of a complete and accurate
            salesperson's transfer application. In the interim at such time as the change in affiliation
            of the salesperson occurs, he shall maintain a copy of the notification sent to the
            board as his temporary license pending receipt of his new current license. This temporary
            transfer license shall expire at the end of 45 days from the date on the transfer
            application. It shall be the duty of the applicant to notify the board if a new license
            or other pertinent communication is not received from the board within 30 days of
            the submission of the transfer application. The new license shall be issued for the
            remainder of the period covered by the previous license. The fee for the issuance
            of such changed license shall be determined by regulation.  Section [25] 324 .  Termination of employment or business.  (a)  Salesperson's license to be surrendered after termination of employment.--Within ten
            days after termination of employment, the dealer shall surrender that salesperson's
            license to the board. If the license is not in the dealer's possession, then it will
            be the responsibility of the salesperson to return the license to the board.  (b)  Dealer's, branch lot or vehicle auction license to be surrendered after termination
            of business.--Within ten days after termination of business activities, the dealer,
            branch lot or vehicle auction shall surrender to the board all of its licenses and
            its salespersons' licenses issued by the board.  Section [26] 325 .  Exemption from licensure and registration.  This act shall not be construed to require licensure and registration in the following
            cases:  (1)  Public officers in the conduct of sales of vehicles in the performance of their official
            duties.  (2)  Sales finance companies and banks licensed under the provisions of the act of June
            28, 1947 (P.L.1110, No.476), known as the Motor Vehicle Sales Finance Act, in the
            conduct of sales of vehicles which have been repossessed by them.  (3)  The sale, exchange or purchase by a person in one calendar year of fewer than five
            vehicles, except manufactured housing or mobile homes, on which sales tax has been
            paid at the purchase of the vehicle by that person. Where such a vehicle is authorized
            under Article II of the act of March 4, 1971 (P.L.6, No.2), known as the Tax Reform
            Code of 1971, to be transferred from the person who paid the sales tax to another
            without being subject to sales tax, such as, but not limited to, wife and husband
            transfers or disbursements from an estate to a beneficiary, the recipient of the vehicle
            shall be permitted to sell such vehicle without paying sales tax prior to his sale
            of the vehicle.  (4)  The sale, exchange or purchase of fewer than five manufactured housing or mobile homes
            by a person in one calendar year.  20180134u18s  Section 18.  Section 27 of the act is amended to read:  Section [27] 326 .  Limitations on establishing or relocating dealers.  (a)  Additional or relocation of new vehicle dealers.--  (1)  In the event that a manufacturer seeks to enter into a franchise establishing an additional
            new vehicle dealer or relocating an existing new vehicle dealer within or into a relevant
            market area where the same line-make is then represented, the manufacturer shall in

            relevant market area of the intention to establish an additional dealer or to relocate
            an existing dealer within or into that market area. Within 20 days after the end of
            any appeal procedure provided by the manufacturer, any such new vehicle dealer may

            a timely protest has been filed, and that the manufacturer shall not establish the
            proposed new vehicle dealer or relocate the new vehicle dealer until the board has
            held a hearing, nor thereafter, if the board has determined that there is [good] just cause for not permitting the addition or relocation of such new vehicle dealer.

            instance where an existing dealer sells or otherwise transfers all or substantially
            all of its business to a new owner and the new owner, who has been approved by the
            manufacturer or distributor to enter into a franchise agreement, seeks to relocate
            the ongoing, operating dealership franchise from its current licensed address to a
            site within the relevant market area of the existing dealer which is not within five
            miles of another licensed new vehicle dealer for the same line-make of vehicle as
            set forth in subsection (b)(1).  (4)  (i)  Where an automobile, motorcycle or truck manufacturer or distributor seeks to enter

            warranty service facility within or into the affected market areas.  (ii)  The notice required by subparagraph (i) shall include the following information:  (A)  The location of the proposed additional or relocating vehicle warranty service facility.

            rights to file a protest with the board to the establishment of the proposed vehicle
            warranty service facility or the relocation of the vehicle warranty service facility.  (iii)  Within 20 days after the end of any appeal procedure provided by the automobile, motorcycle
            or truck manufacturer, any such new vehicle warranty dealer vehicle service facility

            vehicle dealer to be established.  (5)  Whether the new vehicle dealers of the same line-make in that relevant market area
            are providing adequate competition and convenient customer care for the vehicles of
            the line-make in the market area which shall include the adequacy of vehicle sales
            and service facilities, equipment, supply of vehicle parts and qualified service personnel.  (6)  Whether the establishment of an additional new vehicle dealer would increase competition
            and whether such increased competition would be in the public interest.  (7)  The effect the denial of relocation will have on a relocating dealer.  20180134u19s  Section 19.  Section 27.1 of the act, amended June 28, 2018 (P.L.420, No.59), is amended to read:  Section [27.1] 327 .  Licensing cost.

            action, any of the following factors may be considered:  (1)  The extent of the affected dealer's penetration in the area of sales responsibility
            compared to other similarly situated dealers and market conditions.  (2)  The nature and extent of the dealer's investment in the dealer's business.

            and shall state that, within 30 days following receipt of the notice, the dealer shall
            provide to the manufacturer or distributor written notice of intent to cure all claimed
            deficiencies. The dealer shall have 90 days following receipt of the original notice
            to rectify the deficiencies.  (2)  If the deficiencies are rectified within 90 days, the manufacturer's or distributor's
            notice shall be voided. If the dealer fails to provide the notice of intent to cure
            the deficiencies in the prescribed time period or fails to cure the deficiencies in
            the time period provided, the termination, cancellation or nonrenewal shall take effect
            30 days after the dealer's receipt of the original notice. If the dealer has new and
            untitled inventory on hand, it may be sold under section 506.  (d)  Time period of notice.--The notice period may be reduced to 30 days if the manufacturer's

            of the following just-cause factors:  (1)  A dealer or one of its owners has been convicted of or has entered a plea of nolo
            contendere to a felony.  (2)  The abandonment or closing of the business operations of the dealer for 10 consecutive

            or other cause over which the dealer has no control.  (3)  A significant misrepresentation by the dealer materially affecting the business relationship.  (4)  A suspension or revocation of the dealer's license or refusal to renew the dealer's
            license by the department.  (5)  A material violation of this chapter which is not resolved within 30 days after the
            written notice by the manufacturer.  (e)  Nonapplicability of notice.--The notice provisions of subsection (c) do not apply
            if the reason for termination, cancellation or nonrenewal is the dealer's insolvency,

            with a manufacturer or distributor with or without just cause by giving 30 days' written
            notice.  (1)  If the termination or cancellation is for just cause, the notice shall state all reasons
            for the proposed termination or cancellation and shall state that if, within 30 days
            following receipt of the notice, the manufacturer or distributor provides to the dealer
            a written notice of intent to cure all claimed deficiencies, the manufacturer or distributor
            will then have 90 days following receipt of the original notice to rectify the deficiencies.  (2)  If the deficiencies are rectified within 90 days, the dealer's notice shall be voided.
            If the manufacturer or distributor fails to provide the notice of intent to cure the
            deficiencies or fails to cure the deficiencies in the time period prescribed in the
            original notice, the termination or cancellation shall take effect as provided in
            the original notice.  (b)  Just cause shown.--If the dealer terminates, cancels or fails to renew the manufacturer/dealer
            agreement without just cause, the provisions of section 506 shall not apply. If the
            dealer terminates, cancels or fails to renew the manufacturer/dealer agreement with
            just cause, the provisions of section 506 shall apply. The dealer has the burden of
            showing just cause for the proposed termination, cancellation or nonrenewal action
            by a dealer due to any of the following just-cause factors:  (1)  A manufacturer being convicted of or entering a plea of nolo contendere to a felony.  (2)  The business operations of the manufacturer have been abandoned or closed for 10 consecutive

            relationship.  (4)  A material violation of this chapter which is not cured within 30 days after written
            notice by the dealer.  (5)  A declaration by the manufacturer of bankruptcy, insolvency or the occurrence of an
            assignment for the benefit of creditors or bankruptcy.  Section 506.  Repurchase of inventory.  (a)  General rule.--If the manufacturer/dealer agreement is terminated, canceled or not
            renewed by the dealer for just cause as described in section 505(b) and the manufacturer
            fails to provide notice or cure the claimed deficiencies as provided in section 505(a),
            the manufacturer shall, at the dealer's option and within 45 days after termination,
            cancellation or nonrenewal, repurchase:  (1)  All new, untitled recreational vehicles that were acquired from the manufacturer or
            distributor within 12 months before the effective date of the notice of termination,
            cancellation or nonrenewal that have not been used, except for demonstration purposes,
            and that have not been altered or damaged, at 100% of the net invoice cost, including
            transportation, less applicable rebates and discounts to the dealer.  (2)  In the event any of the vehicles repurchased under this section are damaged but do
            not trigger a consumer disclosure requirement, the amount due the dealer shall be
            reduced by the cost to repair the vehicle. Damage prior to delivery to the dealer
            that is disclosed at the time of delivery will not disqualify repurchase under this
            subsection.  (3)  All undamaged accessories and proprietary parts sold to the dealer for resale within
            the 12 months prior to termination, cancellation or nonrenewal, if accompanied by
            the original invoice, at 105% of the original net price paid to the manufacturer or
            distributor to compensate the dealer for handling, packing and shipping the parts.  (4)  Properly functioning diagnostic equipment, special tools, current signage or other
            equipment and machinery which was purchased by the dealer upon the manufacturer's
            or distributor's request within five years prior to the termination, cancellation
            or nonrenewal and which can no longer be used in the normal course of the dealer's
            ongoing business at 100% of the dealer's net cost plus freight.  (b)  Sale of remaining inventory after termination.--  (1)  A dealer is not prohibited from selling the remaining in-stock inventory of a particular
            line-make after a manufacturer/dealer agreement has been terminated or not renewed
            under section 504.  (2)  If recreational vehicles of a line-make subject to the terminated agreement are not
            repurchased or required to be repurchased by the manufacturer or distributor, the
            dealer may continue to sell the recreational vehicles that are subject to the terminated
            manufacturer/dealer agreement and are currently in stock until those recreational
            vehicles are no longer in the dealer's inventory.  Section 507.  Transfer of dealership and family succession.  (a)  General rule.--  (1)  If a dealer desires to make a change in ownership by the sale of the business assets,
            stock transfer or otherwise, the dealer shall give the manufacturer or distributor
            written notice at least 30 business days before the closing, including all supporting
            documentation as may be reasonably required by the manufacturer or distributor to
            determine if an objection to the sale may be made. In the absence of a breach by the
            selling dealer of its manufacturer/dealer agreement or this chapter, the manufacturer
            or distributor shall not object to the proposed change in ownership unless the prospective
            transferee:  (i)  has previously been terminated by the manufacturer for breach of its dealer agreement;  (ii)  has been convicted of a felony or a crime of fraud, deceit or moral turpitude;  (iii)  lacks a license required by law;  (iv)  does not have an active line of credit sufficient to purchase a manufacturer's product;
            or  (v)  has undergone in the last 10 years bankruptcy, insolvency, a general assignment for
            the benefit of creditors or the appointment of a receiver, trustee or conservator
            to take possession of the transferee's business or property.  (2)  If the manufacturer or distributor objects to a proposed change of ownership, the
            manufacturer or distributor shall give written notice of its reasons to the dealer
            within 10 business days after receipt of the dealer's notification and complete documentation.
            The manufacturer or distributor has the burden of proof with regard to its objection.
            If the manufacturer or distributor does not give timely notice of its objection, the
            change or sale shall be deemed approved.  (3)  It is unlawful for a manufacturer or distributor to fail to provide a dealer an opportunity
            to designate, in writing, a family member as a successor to the dealership. It is
            unlawful to prevent or refuse to honor the succession to a dealership by a family
            member of the dealer unless the manufacturer or distributor has provided to the dealer
            written notice of its objections within 10 days after receipt of the dealer's modification
            of the dealer's succession plan. In the absence of a breach of the dealer agreement,
            the manufacturer may object to the succession for the following reasons only:  (i)  conviction of the successor of a felony or a crime of fraud, deceit or moral turpitude;  (ii)  bankruptcy or insolvency of the successor during the past 10 years;  (iii)  prior termination by the manufacturer of the successor for breach of a dealer agreement;  (iv)  the successor does not have an active line of credit sufficient to purchase the manufacturer's
            product; or  (v)  the successor lacks a license required by law.  (b)  Burden of proof.--The manufacturer or distributor has the burden of proof regarding
            the manufacturer's or distributor's objection. A family member may not succeed to
            a dealership if the succession involves, without the manufacturer's or distributor's
            consent, a relocation of the business or an alteration of the terms and conditions
            of the manufacturer/dealer agreement.  Section 508.  Warranty obligations.  (a)  General rule.--Each warrantor shall:  (1)  Specify in writing to each of its dealer obligations, if any, for preparation, delivery
            and warranty service on its products.  (2)  Compensate the dealer for warranty service required of the dealer by the warrantor.  (3)  Provide to the dealer the schedule of compensation to be paid and the time allowances
            for the performance of  work and service. The schedule of compensation must include reasonable compensation
            for diagnostic work as well as warranty labor.  (b)  Time allowances and compensation.--Time allowances for the diagnosis and performance
            of warranty labor must be reasonable for the work to be performed. In the determination
            of what constitutes reasonable compensation under this section, the principal factors
            to be given consideration shall be the actual wage rates being paid by the dealer
            and the actual retail labor rate being charged by the dealers in the community in
            which the dealer is doing business. The compensation of a dealer for warranty labor
            may not be less than the posted labor rates actually charged by the dealer for similar

            fraud or misrepresentation.  (e)  Warranty claims.--The dealer shall submit warranty claims within 45 days after completing
            work.  (f)  Warrantor notification.--If a dealer receives a written or verbal complaint from a

            against losses or damages to the extent that the losses or damages are caused by the
            negligence or willful misconduct of the new recreational vehicle dealer.  (b)  Denial of indemnification.--A new recreational vehicle dealer may be denied indemnification
            if the new recreational vehicle dealer fails to remedy a known and announced defect
            in accordance with the written instructions of a warrantor for whom the new recreational
            vehicle dealer is obligated to perform warranty service.  (c)  Pending lawsuits.--  (1)  A new recreational vehicle dealer shall provide to a warrantor a copy of any pending
            lawsuit in which allegations are made that are covered by the provisions of this section

            the dealer or is damaged in transit to the dealer when the carrier or means of transportation
            has been selected by the manufacturer or distributor, the dealer shall notify the
            manufacturer or distributor of the damage within the time frame specified in the manufacturer/dealer
            agreement and:  (1)  request from the manufacturer or distributor authorization to replace the components,
            parts and accessories damaged or otherwise correct the damage; or  (2)  reject the vehicle within the time frame set forth in subsection (d).  (b)  Refusal or failure to repair.--If the manufacturer or distributor refuses or fails
            to authorize repair of the damage within 10 days after receipt of notification or
            if the dealer rejects the recreational vehicle because of damage, ownership of the
            new recreational vehicle shall revert to the manufacturer or distributor.  (c)  Obligations.--The dealer shall exercise due care in custody of the damaged recreational
            vehicle, but the dealer shall have no other obligations, financial or otherwise, with
            respect to that recreational vehicle.  (d)  Time frame.--The time frame for inspection and rejection by the dealer must be part
            of the manufacturer/dealer agreement and may not be less than two business days after
            the physical delivery of the recreational vehicle.  (e)  Unreasonable mileage.--A recreational vehicle that has, at the time of delivery to
            the dealer, an unreasonable amount of miles on its odometer, as determined by the
            dealer, may be subject to rejection by the dealer and reversion of the vehicle to
            the manufacturer or distributor. In no instance shall a dealer deem an amount less
            than the distance between the dealer and the manufacturer's factory or a distributor's
            point of distribution, plus 100 miles, as unreasonable.  (f)  Notice to dealer.--Each manufacturer or distributor of new recreational vehicles sold
            or transferred to a new recreational vehicle dealer shall notify the new recreational
            vehicle dealer in writing prior to delivery of the recreational vehicle of any material
            damage to the recreational vehicle which is known to the manufacturer or distributor
            which was sustained or incurred by the vehicle at any time after the manufacturing
            process is complete but prior to delivery of the recreational vehicle to the dealer.
            A dealer may reject the delivery of a nonconforming recreational vehicle under the
            provisions of 13 Pa.C.S. (relating to commercial code), and the following shall apply:  (1)  When selling a new recreational vehicle, each new recreational vehicle dealer shall
            notify the purchaser in writing at the time of sale of any material damage sustained
            or incurred by the recreational vehicle at any time after the manufacturing process
            is complete which is disclosed by the manufacturer to the new recreational vehicle
            dealer.  (2)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to diminish any obligation to provide notice
            to the purchaser of a new recreational vehicle which obligation is imposed by any
            other provision of law or by any judicial decision, including, but not limited to,
            the act of December 17, 1968 (P.L.1224, No.387), known as the Unfair Trade Practices

            to, threatening to terminate, cancel or not renew a manufacturer/dealer agreement

            to purchase under the manufacturer/dealer agreement or delay product delivery as an
            inducement to amending the manufacturer/dealer agreement.  Section 512.  Applicability.  To the extent the provisions of this chapter are inconsistent with any other provisions
            of this act as applied to a recreational vehicle dealer, manufacturer, distributor
            or supplier, this chapter controls. Unless inconsistent with the provisions in this
            chapter or expressly excluded, the provisions of this act apply to recreational vehicle
            dealers, manufacturers, distributors and suppliers.  Section 513.  Severability.  The provisions of this chapter are severable. If any provision of this chapter or
            its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity shall

            the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes, in post-trial matters, further providing for
            postconviction DNA testing; in DNA data and testing, further providing for policy,
            for definitions, for powers and duties of State Police, for State DNA Data Base, for

            DNA samples, for procedures for conduct, disposition and use of DNA analysis, for
            DNA data base exchange and for expungement.    The General Assembly finds and declares as follows:  (1)  Postconviction DNA testing has exonerated wrongfully convicted individuals and identified
            real perpetrators of crimes.  (2)  To the extent possible, DNA testing of evidence before trial is encouraged to help
            prevent wrongful convictions and to lead to earlier detection and conviction of actual
            perpetrators.    The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania hereby enacts as follows:    20180147u1s  Section 1.  Section 9543.1 of Title 42 of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes is amended to
            read:  § 9543.1.  Postconviction DNA testing.  (a)  Motion.--  (1)  An individual convicted of a criminal offense in a court of this Commonwealth [and
            serving a term of imprisonment or awaiting execution because of a sentence of death]
            may apply by making a written motion to the sentencing court at any time for the performance of forensic DNA testing on specific evidence that is related
            to the investigation or prosecution that resulted in the judgment of conviction.  (2)  The evidence may have been discovered either prior to or after the applicant's conviction.
            The evidence shall be available for testing as of the date of the motion. If the evidence
            was discovered prior to the applicant's conviction, the evidence shall not have been
            subject to the DNA testing requested because the technology for testing was not in
            existence at the time of the trial or the applicant's counsel did not seek testing
            at the time of the trial in a case where a verdict was rendered on or before January
            1, 1995, or the  evidence was subject to the testing, but newer technology  could provide substantially more accurate and substantially  probative results, or the applicant's counsel sought funds from the court to pay for the testing because
            his client was indigent and the court refused the request despite the client's indigency.  (3)  A request for DNA testing under this section shall be by written petition and shall
            be filed with the clerk of courts of the judicial district where the sentence is imposed.  (4)  DNA testing may be sought at any time if the motion is made in a timely manner and
            for the purpose of demonstrating the applicant's actual innocence and not to delay
            the execution of sentence or administration of justice.  (5)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a plea of guilty to a crime of violence,
            as defined in section 9714(g) (relating to sentences for second and subsequent offenses),
            or a confession given by an applicant concerning the offense for which the applicant
            was convicted, shall not prohibit the applicant from asserting actual innocence under
            subsection (c)(2) or the court from making a determination and ordering DNA testing
            under subsection (d)(2).  (6)  The motion shall explain how, after review of the record of the applicant's trial,
            there is a reasonable possibility if the applicant is under State supervision, or
            there is a reasonable probability if the applicant is not under State supervision,
            or after review of the record of the applicant's guilty plea there is a reasonable
            probability, that the testing would produce exculpatory evidence that would establish:  (i)  the applicant's actual innocence of the offense for which the applicant was convicted;  (ii)  in a capital case, the applicant's actual innocence of the charged or uncharged conduct
            constituting an aggravating circumstance under section 9711(d) (relating to sentencing
            procedure for murder of the first degree) if the applicant's exoneration of the conduct
            would result in vacating a sentence of death; or  (iii)  in a capital case, a mitigating circumstance under section 9711(e)(7) under the circumstances
            set forth in section 9711(c)(1)(iv).  (b)  Notice to the Commonwealth.--  (1)  Upon receipt of a motion under subsection (a), the court shall notify the Commonwealth
            and shall afford the Commonwealth an opportunity to respond to the motion.  (2)  Upon receipt of a motion under subsection (a) or notice of the motion, as applicable,
            the Commonwealth and the court shall take the steps reasonably necessary to ensure
            that any remaining biological material in the possession of the Commonwealth or the
            court is preserved pending the completion of the proceedings under this section.  (c)  Requirements.--In any motion under subsection (a), under penalty of perjury, the applicant
            shall:  (1)  (i)  specify the evidence to be tested;  (ii)  state that the applicant consents to provide samples of bodily fluid for use in the
            DNA testing; and  (iii)  acknowledge that the applicant understands that, if the motion is granted, any data
            obtained from any DNA samples or test results may be entered into law enforcement
            databases, may be used in the investigation of other crimes and may be used as evidence
            against the applicant in other cases.  (2)  (i) in a sworn statement subject to the penalties  under 18 Pa.C.S. §§ 4902 (relating to perjury) and 4903  (relating to false swearing), assert the applicant's actual innocence of the offense for which the applicant was
            convicted and that the applicant seeks DNA testing  for the purpose of demonstrating the applicant's actual  innocence ; and  (ii)  in a capital case:  (A)  assert the applicant's actual innocence of the charged or uncharged conduct constituting
            an aggravating circumstance under section 9711(d) [(relating to sentencing procedure
            for murder of the first degree)] if the applicant's exoneration of the conduct would
            result in vacating a sentence of death; or  (B)  assert that the outcome of the DNA testing would establish a mitigating circumstance
            under section 9711(e)(7) if that mitigating circumstance was presented to the sentencing
            judge or jury and facts as to that issue were in dispute at the sentencing hearing.  (3)  present a prima facie case demonstrating that the:  (i)  identity of or the participation in the crime by the perpetrator was at issue in the
            proceedings that resulted in the applicant's conviction and sentencing; and  (ii)  DNA testing of the specific evidence, assuming exculpatory results, would establish:  (A)  the applicant's actual innocence of the offense for which the applicant was convicted;  (B)  in a capital case, the applicant's actual innocence of the charged or uncharged conduct
            constituting an aggravating circumstance under section 9711(d) if the applicant's
            exoneration of the conduct would result in vacating a sentence of death; or  (C)  in a capital case, a mitigating circumstance under section 9711(e)(7) under the circumstances
            set forth in [subsection (c)(1)(iv)] section 9711(c)(1) (iv) .  (d)  Order.--  (1)  Except as provided in paragraph (2), the court shall order the testing requested in
            a motion under subsection (a) under reasonable conditions designed to preserve the
            integrity of the evidence and the testing process upon a determination, after review
            of the record of the applicant's trial, that the:  (i)  requirements of subsection (c) have been met;  (ii)  evidence to be tested has been subject to a chain of custody sufficient to establish
            that it has not been altered in any material respect; and  (iii)  motion is made in a timely manner and for the purpose of demonstrating the applicant's
            actual innocence and not to delay the execution of sentence or administration of justice.  (2)  The court shall not order the testing requested in a motion under subsection (a) if,
            after review of the record of the applicant's trial, the court determines that there
            is no reasonable possibility for an applicant under State  supervision, or there is no reasonable probability for an  applicant not under State supervision , or after review of the  record of the applicant's guilty plea, the court determines  that there is no reasonable probability, that the testing would produce exculpatory evidence that:  (i)  would establish the applicant's actual innocence of the offense for which the applicant
            was convicted;  (ii)  in a capital case, would establish the applicant's actual innocence of the charged
            or uncharged conduct constituting an aggravating circumstance under section 9711(d)
            if the applicant's exoneration of the conduct would result in vacating a sentence
            of death; or  (iii)  in a capital case, would establish a mitigating circumstance under section 9711(e)(7)
            under the circumstances set forth in [subsection (c)(1)(iv)] section 9711(c)(1)(iv) .  (3)  Any DNA testing order under this section shall constitute a final order. An applicant
            or the Commonwealth may appeal a decision denying or granting a DNA testing order
            in accordance with the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure.  (4)  Any decision granting or denying a DNA testing order shall include an explanation
            by the court of how the testing requested in a motion under subsection (a) has met
            or fails to have met the requirements under paragraphs (1), (2) and (3).  (5)  Upon determining the petitioner has met the applicable burden established in paragraph
            (1) or (2), the court may require the Commonwealth to prepare an inventory of evidence
            related to the case and serve a copy of the inventory to the prosecution, the applicant,
            the applicant's attorney, if applicable, and the court. The inventory may include,
            but not be limited to, a list of evidence collected and forensic testing previously
            done relating to the evidence and the names of agencies that conducted the forensic
            testing.  (e)  Testing procedures.--  (1)  Any DNA testing ordered under this section shall be conducted by:  (i)  a laboratory mutually selected by the Commonwealth and the applicant;  (ii) a laboratory selected by the court that ordered  the testing if the Commonwealth and the applicant are unable to agree on a laboratory[, a laboratory
            selected by the court that ordered the testing]; or  (iii)  if the applicant is indigent, the testing shall be conducted by the Pennsylvania State
            Police or, at the Pennsylvania State Police's sole discretion, by a laboratory designated
            by the Pennsylvania State Police.  (2)  The costs of any testing ordered under this section shall be paid:  (i)  by the applicant; or  (ii)  in the case of an applicant who is indigent, by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  (3)  [Testing conducted by the Pennsylvania State Police shall be carried out in accordance
            with the protocols and procedures established by the Pennsylvania State Police.] To  the extent possible and not inconsistent with best laboratory  practices, the testing shall be conducted in a manner that  ensures that some portion of the sample is preserved for  replication of testing. If the laboratory determines it may  be necessary to consume the entirety of any sample during  testing, the laboratory shall inform the prosecution, the  applicant and the applicant's attorney, if applicable, of its  recommendation and obtain the prosecution and the applicant's  consent before proceeding. If the prosecution and the  applicant do not consent, the court may issue any appropriate  order before testing proceeds.  (4)  If testing is performed by a private laboratory and a DNA database search is anticipated,
            the applicant shall ensure that the chosen laboratory is accredited by an accreditation
            body that is a signatory to the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation
            Mutual Recognition Agreement that is designated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation
            in accordance with 34 U.S.C. § 12591 (relating to quality assurance and proficiency
            testing standards), that requires conformance to forensic science requirements and
            that the accreditation include DNA testing, and is compliant with Federal Bureau of
            Investigation quality assurance standards.  (5)  When testing is performed by a private laboratory, the public laboratory shall take
            all reasonable measures before the testing is conducted to ensure that the results
            of the testing may be entered into CODIS so that a comparison to known offender or
            crime scene profiles may be made if the laboratory and test results otherwise satisfy
            the criteria for database entry.  (6)  Testing conducted by the Pennsylvania State Police shall be carried out in accordance
            with the protocols and procedures established by the Pennsylvania State Police.  (7)  To the extent possible, if communication with the parties regarding the testing process
            and test results is necessary, the testing laboratory shall communicate with counsel
            for petitioner and the Commonwealth simultaneously.  (8)  No direct communication involving the testing laboratory without the inclusion of
            a representative of each party shall occur.  (f)  Posttesting procedures.--  (1)  After the DNA testing conducted under this section has been completed, the applicant
            may, pursuant to section 9545(b)(2) (relating to jurisdiction and proceedings), during
            the [60-day] one-year period beginning on the date on which the applicant is notified of the test results,
            petition to the court for postconviction relief pursuant to section 9543(a)(2)(vi)
            (relating to eligibility for relief).  (2)  Upon receipt of a petition filed under paragraph (1), the court shall consider the
            petition along with any answer filed by the Commonwealth and shall conduct a hearing
            thereon.  (3)  In any hearing on a petition for postconviction relief filed under paragraph (1),
            the court shall determine whether the exculpatory evidence resulting from the DNA
            testing conducted under this section would have changed the outcome of the trial as
            required by section 9543(a)(2)(vi).  (4)  If testing complies with Federal Bureau of Investigation requirements and the data
            meets NDIS criteria, profiles obtained from the testing shall be searched or uploaded
            to CODIS.  (5)  When testing is conducted by a private laboratory, a court may order a public laboratory
            with access to CODIS to take the necessary measures to ensure the DNA profile obtained
            from probative biological material from crime scene evidence can be uploaded to CODIS
            by the public laboratory. Necessary measures may include requiring the public laboratory
            to conduct a review of the private laboratory's facilities or records to ensure that
            the private laboratory complies with Federal Bureau of Investigation requirements
            regarding CODIS. If the private laboratory meets Federal Bureau of Investigation and
            CODIS requirements, the court may order the public laboratory to upload the DNA profile
            to determine whether the profile matches a profile of a known individual or a profile
            from an unsolved crime. The DNA profile submitted to the databases must comply with
            the Federal Bureau of Investigation requirements for the uploading of DNA profiles
            to CODIS, and the Commonwealth shall take all reasonable measures to ensure that the
            testing complies with the requirements.  (6)  If DNA testing conclusively identifies the DNA profile of the applicant on probative
            and inculpatory evidence, the court shall dismiss the petition and may make any further
            orders that are appropriate. An order under this paragraph may:  (i)  direct that the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole be notified of the test
            results; or  (ii)  mandate that the applicant's DNA profile be added to the Commonwealth's convicted
            offender database.  (g)  Effect of motion.--The filing of a motion for forensic DNA testing pursuant to subsection
            (a) shall have the following effect:  (1)  The filing of the motion shall constitute the applicant's consent to provide samples
            of bodily fluid for use in the DNA testing.  (2)  The data from any DNA samples or test results obtained as a result of the motion may
            be entered into law enforcement databases, may be used in the investigation of other
            crimes and may be used as evidence against the applicant in other cases.  (h)  Definitions.--As used in this section, the following words and phrases shall have

            consideration in excess of one thousand five hundred dollars except to the highest
            bidder after due notice by advertisement for bids or advertisement of a public auction

            the case of a public auction, the board of township commissioners may establish a
            minimum bid based on the fair market value of the real property.  Except as otherwise hereinafter provided in the case of personal property of an estimated
            fair market value of less than [one thousand dollars] two thousand dollars , no township personal property shall be disposed of, by sale or otherwise, except

            auction shall be announced in such advertisement, and sale of the property so advertised
            shall be made to the best responsible bidder. A public auction of personal property
            may be conducted by means of an online or electronic auction sale. During an electronic
            auction sale, bids shall be accepted electronically at the time and in the manner
            designated in the advertisement. During the electronic auction, each bidder shall
            have the capability to view the bidder's bid rank or the high bid price. Bidders may

            auction shall be accessible for public inspection. The purchase price shall be paid
            by the high bidder immediately or at a reasonable time after the conclusion of the
            electronic auction as determined by the board of township commissioners. In the event
            that shipping costs are incurred, they shall be paid by the high bidder. A township
            that has complied with the advertising requirements of this clause may provide additional
            public notice of the sale by bids or public auction in any manner deemed appropriate

            the electronic auction and the date, time and duration of the electronic auction.
            The board of township commissioners may reject any bids received if the bids are believed
            to be less than the fair market value of the property. The board of township commissioners
            shall, by resolution, adopt a procedure for the sale of surplus personal property,
            either individual items or lots of items, of an estimated fair market value of less
            than [one thousand dollars] two thousand dollars and the approval of the board of township commissioners shall not be required for

            by clause LXXII of section 1502, or where real property is to be sold to a nonprofit
            housing corporation as authorized by clause LXXIII of section 1502. When real property
            is to be sold to a nonprofit corporation organized as a public library or to a nonprofit
            medical service corporation or to a nonprofit housing corporation the board of township
            commissioners may elect to accept such nominal consideration for such sale as it shall
            deem appropriate. Real property sold pursuant to this clause to a volunteer fire company,
            volunteer ambulance service or volunteer rescue squad, nonprofit medical service corporation
            or to a nonprofit housing corporation shall be subject to the condition that when
            the property is not used for the purposes of the company, service, squad or the corporation
            the property shall revert to the township.  Any officer who sells and each officer who votes in favor of selling any township
            property, either real or personal, without the provisions of this section having been
            complied with, shall be subject to surcharge in the amount of any loss sustained by
            the township by reason of such sale.  The exemption granted by this clause to nonprofit corporations engaged in community,
            industrial, commercial or affordable housing development or reuse shall not apply
            to property owned and operated by the township or subcontracted or operated on the
            behalf of the township in order to conduct existing governmental functions.  20180151u2s  Section 2.  This act shall take effect in 60 days.    APPROVED--The 24th day of October, A.D. 2018.    TOM WOLF   "

            of their affairs, counties of this Commonwealth, now in existence and those hereafter
            created, shall be divided into nine classes as follows:  (1)  First Class Counties, those having a population of 1,500,000 inhabitants and over.  (2)  Second Class Counties, those having a population of [800,000] 1,000,000 and more but less than 1,500,000 inhabitants.  (2.1)  Second Class A Counties, those having a population of 500,000 and more but less than
            [800,000] 1,000,000 inhabitants.  (3)  (i)  Third Class Counties, those having a population of 210,000 and more but less than
            500,000 inhabitants.  (ii)  After the results of any Federal Decennial Census are published, any county of the
            third class having a population of 500,000 inhabitants and over may elect not to become
            a county of the second class A by enacting an ordinance or adopting a resolution of
            the [Board of County Commissioners] commissioners not later than February 15 of the year following the year in which the figures from
            the Federal Decennial Census are certified by the United States Department of Commerce
            and available.  (4)  Fourth Class Counties, those having a population of 145,000 and more but less than
            210,000 inhabitants.  (5)  Fifth Class Counties, those having a population of 90,000 and more but less than 145,000
            inhabitants.  (6)  Sixth Class Counties, those having a population of 45,000 and more but less than 90,000
            inhabitants and those having a population of 35,000 and more but less than 45,000
            inhabitants which by ordinance or resolution of the [Board of County Commissioners] commissioners elect to be a county of the sixth class.  (7)  Seventh Class Counties, those having a population of 20,000 or more but less than
            45,000 inhabitants and those having a population of 35,000 and more but less than
            45,000 inhabitants which have not elected to be a county of the sixth class.  (8)  Eighth Class Counties, those having a population of less than 20,000 inhabitants.  Section 211.  Ascertainment, Certification and Effect of Change of Class.--(a)  The classification of counties shall be ascertained and fixed according to their population
            by reference from time to time to the decennial United States census as [hereinafter
            provided, deducting therefrom] provided in this  section, less the number of persons residing on any lands that have been ceded to the United States.  (b)  Whenever it shall appear by any [such] decennial census that [any] a county has attained a population entitling it to an advance in classification, or
            whenever it shall appear by the last two preceding censuses that a county has [heretofore
            or hereafter] decreased in population so as to recede in classification, as [herein
            prescribed] provided in this section , it shall be the duty of the Governor, under the great seal of this Commonwealth,
            to certify that fact accordingly, to the [board of county] commissioners on or before
            the first day of October of the year succeeding [that] the year in which the census was taken [or as soon thereafter as may be], which certificate
            shall be forwarded by the commissioners to the recorder of deeds and be recorded in
            [his] the recorder's office.  It is the intent of this section that the classification of any county shall not be
            changed because its population has decreased at the time of one United States decennial
            census, because it is recognized that a change in the form of local government is
            attended by certain expense and hardship, and [such] the change should not be occasioned by a temporary fluctuation in population, but rather
            only after it is demonstrated by two censuses that the population of a county has
            remained below the minimum figure of its class for at least a decade.  (c)  Changes of class ascertained and certified [as aforesaid] shall become effective on
            the first day of January next following the year in which the change was [so] certified
            by the Governor to the county commissioners but the salaries of county officers shall
            not [thereby] be increased or decreased during the term for which they shall have
            been elected. In the municipal election following [such] the certification of change of class and preceding the effective date of [such] the change, the proper number of persons shall be elected to fill any elective office
            which will exist in the county by the change of classification certified. No election
            shall be held for any office which will be abolished as a result of [such] a change of classification.  Section 301.  Petition to [Superior] Commonwealth Court.--(a)  The boundary line between any two or more adjoining counties may be determined, surveyed,
            [relocated] established or marked in the manner provided by this article.  (b)  Such a proceeding shall be instituted on petition of any taxpayer, the [county] commissioners
            or the [corporate authorities] governing body of any political subdivision of any of the counties involved.  Section 302.  [Superior] Commonwealth Court to Designate Neutral Court; Appointment of Commission.--(a)  The court, upon the filing of such petition, shall designate a court of a county not
            affected by the question and not adjoining any of the counties involved to act in
            the proceeding. The designated court [so designated] shall sit in its home county.  (b)  If it appears to the [court so] designated court that the county line, or any part thereof, shall be surveyed or marked, it shall
            appoint a boundary commission, composed of three surveyors or professional engineers [in civil engineering,] licensed or registered in accordance with the act  of May 23, 1945 (P.L.913, No.367), known as the ""Engineer, Land  Surveyor and Geologist Registration Law,"" to act for the court as hereinafter provided.  Section 303.  Compensation, Assistants and Expenses.--(a)  The surveyors or professional engineers [in civil engineering] composing [such] the boundary commission shall each receive such compensation as the court shall fix for the time
            necessarily spent in the discharge of their duties and[, in addition thereto,] shall also be reimbursed the necessary expenses incurred by them respectively while engaged
            upon the work of [such] the commission.  (b)  The boundary commission may employ such assistants as the court shall allow, at a compensation
            to be fixed by the court[, and such assistants shall be reimbursed the actual necessary
            expenses incurred by them respectively while employed by such commission]. Assistants shall also be reimbursed for  actual necessary expenses incurred while employed by the  commission.  (c)  All costs, including the necessary expenses of advertising the meeting of the boundary commissioners as hereinafter provided, and in procuring and setting the permanent monuments [needful] necessary to mark [in a permanent manner such] the county line, the expenses of the boundary commission and its assistants and all other expenses necessarily incurred, shall
            be paid by the interested counties jointly, in equal parts, or by any party or parties
            to the proceeding as the court may direct, upon presentation of properly itemized
            bills, duly verified by affidavit of the person claiming payment or [some one on his] someone on the person's behalf.  Section 304.  Oath; Organization and Duties.--(a)  The members of the boundary commission shall take and subscribe [an oath to perform their duties impartially
            and with fidelity] the  oath as provided in 53 Pa.C.S. § 1141 (relating to form of oaths  of office) prior to assuming duties with the commission .  (b)  The boundary commission shall meet and organize within two weeks of its appointment. It shall
            select from its membership a chairman and also a secretary who shall keep a full record
            of the proceedings and work of the commission. [Before entering upon its duties, it
            shall designate, by advertisement] The commission shall advertise in not more than two newspapers published in each of the counties concerned, a time
            and place of meeting, when and where parties interested shall be heard. After [such] the hearing, it shall, without unreasonable delay, ascertain the location, and survey
            and mark with [suitable] permanent monuments [of a permanent character] the existing county line between such counties[,
            if it shall consider such old county line a proper one].  Section 305.  Authority to Fix [New] Undetermined County Line.--(a)  When the boundary commission [has ascertained, located and determined said line, if it appears to it
            that the existing county line, from any cause whatever, has become inconvenient for
            any purpose, or improper, difficult to ascertain, or not related to the natural or
            other land marks, the commission] cannot determine, ascertain or locate the  existing county line, it shall so report [these facts, or any of them,] to the court of [quarter sessions having appointed
            the commission] common pleas , with a recommendation that a new county line be established in whole or in part.  (b)  [Thereupon, if said] If the court shall be of opinion that it is [to the interest and advantage of the respective
            counties] necessary that a new county line be established, [they may] it shall direct [said] the boundary commission to fix and determine a new county line [and] , to mark the same with [suitable] permanent monuments [of a permanent character] and to  prepare the report as provided in section 306 .  [(c)  Notice shall be given to the counties interested, and to the owners of all lands which
            will be affected by the proposed change, of the time when the recommendation of the
            commission for a new county line will be considered by the court.]  Section 306.  Report of Boundary Commission; Approval by Court; Certification of Line.--(a)  The boundary commission[, or a majority thereof, shall make a report, in writing, and attach thereto] shall prepare a written report containing a map or draft showing the courses and distances of the line ascertained and designated
            by them as the existing county line, or where they may have been directed to fix and
            determine a new county line, such map or draft[, in lieu thereof,] shall instead show the courses and distances of new county line. In either case, the map or draft
            shall also show the lands through which said line passes and the buildings in close
            proximity thereto, together with the roads and streams crossed by or near to such
            line.  (b)  The report and map, signed by a majority of the members of the commission [or a majority of them], shall be filed in the court
            of [quarter sessions] common pleas having been given jurisdiction, and if approved by such court, shall be ordered recorded
            in the records thereof.  (b.1)  Written notice shall be given by the boundary commission to the counties interested,
            and to the owners of all lands which will be affected by the proposed change, of the
            time when the report containing the recommendation of the boundary commission will
            be considered by the court.  (b.2) A copy of the report and approval shall be certified by the [clerk of the court] prothonotary to the [clerk of the court of quarter sessions] prothonotary of each county affected, where it shall be recorded in the records. The line so ascertained,
            surveyed and fixed and so marked shall [thenceforth] , as of the date of the certification, be the boundary line between the counties.  (c)  The [clerk of the court of quarter sessions] prothonotary , having determined the matter, shall certify the approval of the court on two copies
            of the report and map filed in [this] the prothonotary's office and, within thirty days, transmit a copy by mail to the Secretary of [Internal

            hold their offices for a term of four years from the first Monday of January next
            after their election and until their successors shall be duly qualified, but in the
            event that any [such] officer so elected, excepting a county commissioner or auditor,
            shall fail to qualify, or if no successor shall be elected, then the chief deputy,
            first assistant, first deputy or principal deputy in office at the time the vacancy
            occurred shall assume the office until a successor has been appointed pursuant to
            section 409 or until the first Monday in January following the next municipal election,
            whichever period is shorter. In the case of a county commissioner or auditor, there

            of jury commissioner shall expire at the completion of the current jury commissioners'
            terms of office.  (f)  After review of the procedures in effect within the county to ensure that lists of
            potential jurors are a representative cross section of the community, the governing
            body of a county of the second class A or third through eighth class may adopt, by
            a majority vote, a resolution abolishing the office of jury commissioner. Upon approval

            office, such book or books shall be deposited in the office of the prothonotary for
            the inspection of all persons interested therein.  (b)  Coroner  Section 1231.  Deputies.--The coroner may appoint one or more deputies to act in his place and stead,
            as he may deem proper and necessary. Such deputy or deputies shall have the same powers
            as the coroner.  Section 1232.  Duties with Respect to County Morgues.--The coroner of each county in which a county
            morgue is established, shall make general rules and regulations for its government
            and control, and shall appoint suitable persons for each morgue so established to
            have charge of the same, and who shall be removable at the pleasure of the coroner.
            The number of such persons and the salary of each shall be fixed by the salary board.  Section 1233.  Removal of Bodies to Morgue.--Whenever the body of any deceased person who is unidentified
            or which body is unclaimed by proper persons has been found within the county, it
            shall be removed to the county morgue or to a private morgue serving in lieu thereof.
            The coroner shall, if he deems it necessary, cause any such body to be properly embalmed
            or prepared for preservation for such length of time as he may think proper. Any such
            body shall be examined or inspected only by such persons as the coroner authorizes
            in writing, or who are admitted in his presence. No such body shall be removed from
            any such morgue except upon the certificate of the coroner.  Section 1234.  Ambulance.--In each county, the county commissioners may furnish and maintain, from
            the general funds of the county, an ambulance for the removal of bodies of deceased
            persons to and from the morgue, and for the burial of unclaimed bodies. The coroner
            may provide rules and regulations for the use and maintenance of the ambulance.  Section 1235.  Unclaimed Property of Deceased; Sales.--(a)  The coroner shall safely keep in his charge all personal effects and property which

            serving in lieu thereof, and all such effects and property which are delivered to
            him according to law. The coroner shall hold such property for one year, unless sooner
            claimed by legal representatives of the deceased, or otherwise duly and lawfully claimed
            or disposed of.  (b)  After one year, the coroner shall cause such property remaining unclaimed, or so much
            thereof as remains undisposed of according to law, except moneys and such properties
            as securities which may not be subject to such a sale, which shall be turned over
            to the commissioners for proper disposition or use, to be sold at public sale.  (c)  Notice of any such public sale shall be published in at least one newspaper of general
            circulation in the county once a week for three successive weeks. The proceeds of
            all such sales shall be paid immediately into the county treasury, and the coroner
            shall make a written report thereof to the county commissioners, under oath, at the
            same time. If the body has been buried at the expense of the institution district,
            the county shall pay the proceeds of sale, or such property as was not subject to
            sale, as hereinbefore provided, less costs, over to the institution district. The
            foregoing provisions shall be in lieu of escheat to the Commonwealth.  Section 1236.  Private Morgue May be Used.--In any county where a county morgue is not maintained,
            the coroner may cause any body which he is authorized to admit to a county morgue
            to be removed to a private morgue within the county, and, for the use thereof, the
            owner shall be paid a sum to be established by the salary board, to be paid in the
            same manner as fees of coroner's jurors are paid.  Section 1236.1.  Requests for Examinations and Reports.--(a)  Requests for examinations or other professional services by other counties or persons
            may be complied with at the discretion of the coroner pursuant to guidelines established
            by the county commissioners.  (b)  A set of fees and charges for such examinations or professional services shall be
            established by the coroner, subject to approval by the county commissioners, and shall
            be accounted for and paid to the county treasurer pursuant to section 1760. Payment
            for examinations or professional services shall be the responsibility of the county
            or person requesting such services.  (c)  The coroner may charge and collect a fee of up to one hundred dollars ($100) for each
            autopsy report, up to fifty dollars ($50) for each toxicology report, up to fifty
            dollars ($50) for each inquisition or coroner's report and such other fees as may
            be established from time to time for other reports and documents requested by nongovernmental
            agencies. The fees collected shall be accounted for and paid to the county treasurer
            pursuant to section 1760 and shall be used to defray the expenses involved in the
            county complying with the provisions of the act of March 2, 1988 (P.L.108, No.22),
            referred to as the Coroners' Education Board Law.  Section 1237.  Coroner's Investigations.--(a)  The coroner having a view of the body shall investigate the facts and circumstances
            concerning deaths which appear to have happened within the county, regardless where
            the cause thereof may have occurred, for the purpose of determining whether or not
            an autopsy should be conducted or an inquest thereof should be had, in the following
            cases:  (1)  sudden deaths not caused by readily recognizable disease, or wherein the cause of
            death cannot be properly certified by a physician on the basis of prior (recent) medical
            attendance;  (2)  deaths occurring under suspicious circumstances, including those where alcohol, drugs
            or other toxic substances may have had a direct bearing on the outcome;  (3)  deaths occurring as a result of violence or trauma, whether apparently homicidal,
            suicidal or accidental (including, but not limited to, those due to mechanical, thermal,
            chemical, electrical or radiational injury, drowning, cave-ins and subsidences);  (4)  any death in which trauma, chemical injury, drug overdose or reaction to drugs or
            medication or medical treatment was a primary or secondary, direct or indirect, contributory,
            aggravating or precipitating cause of death;  (5)  operative and peri-operative deaths in which the death is not readily explainable
            on the basis of prior disease;  (6)  any death wherein the body is unidentified or unclaimed;  (7)  deaths known or suspected as due to contagious disease and constituting a public hazard;  (8)  deaths occurring in prison or a penal institution or while in the custody of the police;  (9)  deaths of persons whose bodies are to be cremated, buried at sea or otherwise disposed
            of so as to be thereafter unavailable for examination;  (10)  sudden infant death syndrome; and  (11) stillbirths.  (b)  The purpose of the investigation shall be to determine the cause of any such death
            and to determine whether or not there is sufficient reason for the coroner to believe
            that any such death may have resulted from criminal acts or criminal neglect of persons
            other than the deceased.  (c)  As part of this investigation, the coroner shall determine the identity of the deceased
            and notify the next of kin of the deceased.  Section 1238. Autopsy; Inquest; Records.--(a)  If, upon investigation, the coroner shall be unable to determine the cause and manner
            of death, he shall perform or order an autopsy on the body.  (b)  If the coroner is unable to determine the cause and manner of death following the
            autopsy, he may conduct an inquest upon a view of the body, as provided by law. At
            the inquest, the coroner's duty shall be to ascertain the cause of death, to determine
            whether any person other than the deceased was criminally responsible therefor by
            act or neglect, and if so, the identity of the person, and to examine any further
            evidence and witnesses regarding the cause of death.  (c)  The proceedings at the inquest shall be recorded, at the expense of the county, in
            a manner to be provided by the county commissioners.  Section 1239.  Sudden Deaths Defined.--The coroner shall regard any death as sudden if it occurs
            without prior medical attendance by a person who may lawfully execute a certificate
            of death in this Commonwealth, or if, within twenty-four hours of death, the decedent
            was discharged from such medical attendance or a change of such medical attendance
            had occurred, or if any such medical attendance began within twenty-four hours of
            death and the medical attendant refuses or is unable to certify the cause of death.
            Medical attendance includes hospitalization.  The provisions of this section shall not be construed to affect the coroner's discretion
            as to whether or not any death was suspicious, nor shall they be construed to authorize
            a coroner to investigate a sudden death any further than necessary to determine the
            cause and manner of death.  Section 1240.  Bodies not to be Moved.--In all cases where the coroner has jurisdiction to investigate
            the facts and circumstances of death, the body and its surroundings shall be left
            untouched until the coroner has had a view thereof or until he shall otherwise direct
            or authorize, except as may be otherwise provided by law, or as circumstances may
            require. Bodies upon a public thoroughfare or in other places may be removed so much
            as is necessary for precaution against traffic accidents or other serious consequences
            which might reasonably be anticipated if they were left intact.  Section 1241.  Release of Coroner's Jurisdiction.--Whenever the coroner assumes jurisdiction of a
            body pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision or of any other law, the body
            shall not be released or removed from his jurisdiction except upon his directions
            and consent, in accordance with law.  Section 1242.  Cooperation with District Attorney.--In the exercise of his duties as contained in
            this subdivision, the coroner shall, so far as may be practicable, consult and advise
            with the district attorney. The district attorney shall act as counsel to the coroner
            in matters relating to inquests.  Section 1243.  Justices of the Peace not Affected.--The provisions of this subdivision shall not
            be construed to affect any provisions of law requiring or authorizing justices of
            the peace in certain cases to act in place of the coroner.  Section 1244.  Certificate of Cause of Death.--The coroner shall issue a certificate of cause of
            death in all cases referred to him by the local registrar of vital statistics, pursuant
            to the provisions of the act, approved June twenty-nine, one thousand nine hundred
            fifty-three (Pamphlet Laws 304), known as the ""Vital Statistics Law of 1953,"" and
            in all other cases of which he has jurisdiction, if no person duly authorized by the
            said act certifies the cause of death.  Section 1245.  Power of Subpoena and Attachment.--The coroner shall have power to issue subpoenas
            to obtain the attendance of any person whom it may be necessary to examine as a witness
            at any inquest, and to compel attendance by attachment in like manner and to the same
            extent as any court of common pleas of this Commonwealth may or can do in cases pending
            before them, and also to compel in like manner the production of all papers and other
            things relative to such inquest. Such subpoena and attachment shall be served and
            executed by the sheriff or by the coroner himself or his deputy, as the case may require.  Section 1245.1.  Inquests; Juries.--(a)  The coroner may at his discretion summon a jury of six to be selected from the jury
            panels of the court of common pleas.  (b)  The function of such jury shall be to determine the manner of death and whether any
            criminal act or neglect of persons known or unknown caused such death. Such jury shall
            be paid as provided by law as if they were serving the court of common pleas.  Section 1246.  Power to Administer Oaths.--The coroner shall have power to administer oaths and affirmations
            to all persons brought or appearing before him, and any person swearing or affirming
            falsely on such examination shall be guilty of perjury.  Section 1247.  Commitment to County Prison.--If any person appearing before the coroner for examination
            shall refuse to take oath or affirmation, or after having been sworn or affirmed shall
            refuse to make answer to such questions as shall be put to him by the coroner touching
            the matters of the inquest, such persons so refusing may be committed by the coroner
            to the county jail by warrant, under his hand and seal, directed to the sheriff or
            any constable of the county, setting forth particularly the causes of such commitment,
            until he shall submit to be sworn or affirmed or to make answers to such questions
            or be otherwise legally discharged.  Section 1248.  Inquests Not Public.--The coroner may, in his discretion, admit or exclude members
            of the public from any inquest or part thereof, and admit or exclude any person interested
            or suspected from such inquest or any part thereof, but this provision shall not apply
            to representatives of the press. No person excluded may appear by attorney, but any
            person required to attend may have benefit of counsel at such attendance.  Section 1249.  Chief Deputy Sheriff to Act as Sheriff in Case of Vacancy.--If any sheriff shall be
            legally removed from his office or shall die or resign before expiration of the term
            for which he was commissioned, the chief deputy sheriff shall execute the office of
            sheriff and perform all things thereunto appertaining, and receive and retain for
            his own use the compensation provided by law for sheriffs, until another sheriff is
            commissioned and notice thereof is given to such chief deputy sheriff.  Section 1250.  Vacancies; No Fees upon Commissions.--If any person elected to the office of coroner
            shall neglect or refuse, for the space of two months next after such election, to
            assume the duties of said office and to comply with the requirements of the acts of
            Assembly in such cases, the office shall be vacant, and it shall be the duty of the
            Governor, upon the notification of the recorder of deeds, to appoint and commission
            some suitable person to fill such vacancy during the remainder of the term. No fees
            shall hereafter be charged on commissions issued to the coroner.  Section 1251.  Official Records of Coroner.--Every coroner, within thirty (30) days after the end
            of each year, shall deposit all of his official records and papers for the preceding
            year in the office of the prothonotary for the inspection of all persons interested
            therein.  Section 1252.  Solicitor to Coroner.--The coroner may appoint one person learned in the law, as his
            solicitor. Said solicitor shall advise the coroner upon all legal matters that may
            be submitted to him and shall conduct any litigation in connection with the coroner's
            office when requested so to do by the coroner.  Section 1253.  Anatomical Gifts.--The coroner may order the removal of parts of a decedent's body
            for donation purposes in accordance with 20 Pa.C.S. Ch. 86 (relating to anatomical
            gifts).  (c)  Provisions Relating to Sheriffs and Coroners  Section 1260.  Not to Exercise Office Until Commission Granted and Recorded; Penalty.--No person
            elected or appointed to the office of sheriff or coroner shall execute any of the
            duties of such office before a commission shall have been duly granted to him by the
            Governor and left for record, under a penalty of imprisonment for a term not exceeding
            six months, at the discretion of the court of quarter sessions. Such person shall
            nevertheless be liable to any person injured by any acts done by him under color of
            such office.]  20180154u22s  Section 22.  The act is amended by adding articles to read:  ARTICLE XII-A  SHERIFF  Section 1201-A.  Unfinished business of outgoing sheriff.  (a)  General rule.--It shall be the duty of every outgoing sheriff to deliver all unfinished
            and unexecuted writs and process whatsoever to the sheriff's successor whose duty
            it shall be to receive and execute the same as if the writs and process had been originally
            issued and directed to the successor, and to carry out and complete all other official
            duties of the predecessor.  (b)  Successor powers and duties.--Whenever any real estate shall be sold under any execution
            by a sheriff who shall, in any lawful manner, be succeeded in office before any deed
            shall be executed and acknowledged by the sheriff in due form of law for such real
            estate, the sheriff's successor in office shall have the same power and be under the
            same duty to execute and acknowledge a deed for such real estate to the purchaser
            as the sheriff selling such real estate under execution if the sheriff were still
            in office, which deed so executed shall be as effectual in law as if the title had
            been completed by the former sheriff.  (c)  No court order necessary.--No court order shall be necessary in any event to authorize
            an incoming sheriff to carry out the duties as prescribed by this act.  Section 1202-A.  Sheriff may act by deputy.  Whenever the sheriff is or shall be required by law to act in person under or by virtue
            of any writ or process issued by the courts of this Commonwealth, the sheriff may
            act either in person or by a regularly appointed deputy sheriff.  Section 1203-A.  Chief deputy and petition.  (a)  Appointment.--The sheriff of each county shall appoint, by commission duly recorded
            in the office for recording deeds, a chief deputy whose appointment shall be revocable
            by the sheriff on recording in the office for recording deeds a signed revocation.
            The chief deputy, during continuance in office, shall have full power and authority
            to perform any duty incumbent upon the sheriff, with like effect in law as if such
            official act had been done by the sheriff in person, regardless of the ability or
            temporary disability of the sheriff to act, while the sheriff continues in office.
            Nothing in this section shall operate to relieve such sheriff or the sheriff's sureties
            from liability upon their official bond.  (b)  Petition.--If during a vacancy in the office of sheriff the duties of the office cannot
            be discharged in accordance with section 1213-A or any other law, the ranking deputy
            of the office shall petition the court of common pleas to authorize a deputy to perform
            any duty incumbent upon the sheriff. Upon a finding that no other individual has the
            legal capacity to discharge the duty, the court shall authorize the deputy to perform
            the duty during the vacancy with like effect in law as if the official act had been
            done by the sheriff.  Section 1204-A.  Real estate deputies.  The sheriff may have a real estate deputy to take charge of all matters relating to
            sheriff's sales of real estate and distributions of the proceeds thereof, whose appointment
            shall be made and be revocable as provided for the chief deputy. The deputy shall
            have full power to perform all duties incumbent upon the sheriff in like manner as
            the chief deputy with like effect in law as if such official acts had been done by
            the sheriff in person. The duties shall include the execution and acknowledgment of
            sheriff's deeds for real estate upon receipt of the purchase price thereof. Nothing
            in this act shall operate to relieve the sheriff or the sheriff's sureties from liability
            upon their official bonds.  Section 1205-A.  Deputies and clerks.  The sheriff of each county may appoint deputies and clerks to positions established
            in accordance with section 1623 for the transaction of the business of the sheriff's
            office, and may revoke the appointment of deputies in the same manner as the chief
            deputy. In counties of the third through eighth classes, the sheriff may also appoint
            necessary special deputies, when any emergency arises, to assist the sheriff in executing
            any civil or criminal process or court order or in preserving the peace, who shall
            serve only so long as they are absolutely needed.  Section 1206-A.  Deputy sheriff's qualifications.  (a)  Requirements.--A sheriff shall not appoint any person a chief deputy or any other
            deputy sheriff unless the sheriff files with the prothonotary, prior to the appointment

            officer or private guard in any labor dispute, or received any fee or compensation

            whatsoever shall perform, directly or indirectly, any official services or official
            duties for any person, association or corporation, or receive, directly or indirectly,
            any compensation, gifts or gratuities from any person, association or corporation

            in subsection (b) shall, if no appeal is taken, or after an appeal has been finally
            determined in favor of the county or the Commonwealth, be entered by the prothonotary
            as a judgment against the officer. The county or the Commonwealth, as the case may
            be, may execute on a final judgment under this section against the property of the

            Commonwealth, the county or the officer. Such appeal may also be taken by ten or more
            taxpayers in behalf of the county[, in the manner and subject to the restrictions
            provided by article twenty-eight of this act].  [Such] (b)  The appeal shall be entered by the Commonwealth within four months, and by the county
            [and the officer] , the officer or taxpayers within sixty days after the filing of the report. No appeal by officers or taxpayers may be allowed, unless within the time of taking
               the appeal the appellant secures a bond in the sum of one thousand dollars ($1,000)
               with sufficient surety to prosecute the appeal and to pay the costs of appeal in case,
               if the appellant is a taxpayer, the appellant fails to obtain a final decision more
               favorable to the Commonwealth or county than that awarded by the auditors or in case,
               if the appellant is an officer, the appellant fails to obtain a final decision more favorable to the officer than that awarded by the auditors.
               Unless the bond is filed as required under this section, the court of common pleas,
               upon application, shall set aside the appeal.  (c) Upon appeal to the court of common pleas, the controller or auditors shall be required
            to establish the validity of the surcharge and shall establish the loss sustained
            to the county. If the surcharge is upheld on appeal to the court of common pleas,
            the officer so surcharged shall immediately pay the costs and money due to the county , but only to the extent of actual  loss .  Section 1733.  Allowance of [Counsel] Attorney Fees.--[When an appeal is taken from the county auditors' reports or the controller's
            reports and such appeal results favorably to the appellants in such a manner that
            money is recovered for any county, the court hearing such appeal shall make an order
            to pay a counsel fee which it deems just and reasonable to the counsel representing
            such appeal out of the funds so recovered.]  (a)  Upon final determination of an appeal taken under section 1731, attorney fees shall
            be awarded as follows:  (1)  If in the opinion of the court the final determination is more favorable to the officer
            involved than that awarded by the controller or auditors, the county shall pay reasonable
            attorney fees or, under clause (3), a portion of reasonable attorney fees incurred
            by the officer in connection with the surcharge proceeding.  (2)  In the case of an appeal taken by the Commonwealth, the county or taxpayers, if in
            the opinion of the court the final determination is more favorable to the Commonwealth
            or county than that awarded by the controller or auditors, the officer who is the
            subject of the surcharge proceeding shall pay reasonable attorney fees or, under clause
            (3), a portion of reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Commonwealth, county or
            taxpayers in connection with the surcharge proceeding.  (3)  If in the opinion of the court the final determination is in part more favorable to
            the Commonwealth or county and in part more favorable to the officer involved in the
            surcharge proceeding than that awarded by the controller or auditors, the court may
            order the Commonwealth or the county to pay a portion of reasonable attorney fees
            incurred by the officer in connection with the surcharge proceeding or it may order
            the officer who is the subject of the surcharge proceeding to pay a portion of reasonable
            attorney fees incurred by the Commonwealth, county or taxpayer in connection with
            the surcharge proceeding.  (b)  The attorney fees in case of appeals involving accounts other than those of county
            officers shall be allocated in the court's discretion.  (c)  In adjudications of the official actions of the auditors or controllers other than
            appeals as provided in section 1731, the court may award reasonable attorney fees
            to the prevailing party as may be just and equitable. Nothing in this section shall
            be construed as authorizing personal liability for attorney fees or costs.  Section 1750.  Claims Against County.--The controller or the county commissioners in counties having
            no controller shall scrutinize, audit and decide on all bills, claims and demands
            whatsoever against the county, except such as are otherwise provided for in this subdivision.
            All persons having such claims shall first present [the same] the claims to the controller or to the county commissioners and, if required, make oath or affirmation
            before [him or them] the controller or commissioners to the correctness [thereof] of the claims . The controller or the commissioners, as the case may be, may[, if he or they deem
            it necessary,] require evidence, by oath or affirmation, of the claimant and otherwise
            that the claim is legally due and that the supplies or services for which payment
            is claimed have been furnished or performed under legal authority. [He or they] The  controller or commissioners may inquire or ascertain whether any officer or agent of the county is interested
            in the contract under which any claim may arise, or has received or is to receive
            any commission, consideration or gratuity relating thereto, or whether there has been
            any evasion of the provisions of this act by making two or more contracts for small
            amounts which should have been in one. If [he or they] either shall find [that there has been any evasion, or] that any such officer or agent is
            so interested, [he or they] except as provided under  section 1806, or that there has been any evasion, the controller  or commissioners shall refuse to approve the claim.  Section 1751.  Procedure for Approval.--[The] (a)  In  counties having a controller, the controller shall date, upon receipt, all bills, claims and demands [presented to
            him] which  the controller approves , [which he approves and only for such as he approves,] and shall forward the bills,
            claims or demands along with checks therefor to the county commissioners for their
            approval or, if already approved by the commissioners, for their signatures as provided
            in this section. If the county commissioners approve payment of a bill, claim or demand,
            at least two commissioners shall sign the check as properly drawn upon the county
            treasury. In such cases facsimiles of their signatures may be used. The bill, claim
            or demand shall be returned to the controller for filing in [his] the controller's office and the check shall be forwarded to the county treasurer. The county treasurer
            shall sign the check as [his] the  treasurer's draft upon the county treasury, but [he] the  treasurer shall not sign any check not already signed, as herein provided, by the commissioners
            and the controller. Every check issued shall include reference to its corresponding
            bill, claim or demand as well as the number or numbers which may be put upon it by
            the county treasurer. If the county commissioners refuse to approve any bill, claim
            or demand, they shall return the same together with the check involved to the controller
            for filing in [his] the controller's office.  (b) In counties not having a controller, the county commissioners shall approve each transaction
            and the check shall be drawn by their chief clerk who shall keep files of the bills,
            claims or demands involved. At least two commissioners shall sign the checks either
            personally or by facsimile, and they shall be forwarded, together with a check register
            or similar description of the corresponding bill, claim or demand providing a clear
            description of the nature and purpose of the expenditure, to the county treasurer
            for [his] the treasurer's signature.  (c) In all cases the [cancelled] canceled checks or official bank record thereof, shall be filed in the office of the county
            treasurer, but [he] the treasurer shall transmit, at such times as the controller shall establish, a list of all checks
            paid from the county treasury and not previously transmitted, along with appropriate
            identification. The county treasurer and the controller in those counties having a
            controller are authorized to use a facsimile signature on any check which they are
            required to sign. Nothing in this section shall preclude the receipt or transfer of
            funds to or from the county, or payment of a bill, claim or demand, by electronic
            fund transfer, provided that adequate and recognized fiscal and procedural controls,
            together with proper system security, are in place.  Section 1752.  Claims Not Approved by Controller.--If , upon  receipt, the controller does not approve a claim, bill or demand [presented to him, he] , the controller shall within [thirty] fifteen days forward it to the county commissioners together with [his] notice that [he] the controller has disapproved the claim, bill or demand or is unable to approve the same and [his] the reasons therefor. The county commissioners shall consider the claim, bill or demand
            and, if they consider that it should be paid by the county, they shall so notify the
            controller. If the controller thereafter continues to refuse [his] approval no payment
            shall be made thereon by the county except pursuant to an order of court upon a proper
            issue thereto directing the controller to approve payment.  Section 1753.  Reports to Commissioners.--[The] At the request  of the commissioners, the controller shall report to the commissioners monthly [or oftener, if required by
            them,] the amount of outstanding checks registered and the amount of money in the
            treasury or the amount of any particular unencumbered appropriation items involved.  Section 1754.  Fees of Witnesses and Jurors.--Fees of jurors and witnesses shall be ascertained by
            the courts of the county entered upon the records thereof and duly certified by their
            respective clerks to the commissioners being first sworn to or affirmed before the
            controller or the chief clerk of the commissioners as the case may be. [The commissioners,
            then, may draw checks therefor without approval of the controller. The certificates
            shall be filed with the controller or the commissioners where there is no controller
            after the checks are issued.]  Section 1760.  Receipts and Accounts of Money Due County.--The county treasurer shall receive and
            receipt for all moneys due or accruing to the county. [He] The treasurer shall keep proper accounts of all moneys received and disbursed. [His books] The treasurer's records shall be, at all times during office hours, open to the inspection of the controller

            and shall transmit the duplicate or triplicate thereof daily to the controller, or
            to the county commissioners in counties having no controller. Said receipts shall
            be serially numbered, shall indicate the amount of money received, from whom, on what
            account and the date. [He] The treasurer shall likewise keep daily records of all disbursals from the county treasury, and
            shall forward daily records thereof to the controller, or the commissioners as the
            case may be. The controller, or the chief clerk of the commissioners where there is
            no controller, shall have the right to [a certified daily or monthly deposit slip] review depository account information upon request from the county depository or depositories, without prejudice to the said depositories,
            of all moneys deposited in the name of the county by the treasurer. In counties having
            no controller, the treasurer shall render, at least quarterly and oftener, if required,
            a statement of all moneys received and disbursed since [his] the treasurer's last statement, showing the balance remaining in [his] the accounts and the names of the collectors having arrearages in taxes with the amounts
            thereof. [He] The  treasurer shall state [his] the accounts at the end of each fiscal year, which statement shall be examined by the
            commissioners and delivered by them to the auditors for settlement.  20180154u40s  Section 40.  Section 1761 of the act is repealed:  [Section 1761.  Moneys Paid for the Redemption of Unseated Land Sold for Taxes.--The treasurer shall

            land sold for taxes, which have not been called for by the purchasers at treasurer's
            sale or their legal representatives during the continuance in office of such treasurer.
            The county controller or auditor shall charge the moneys so received to said treasurer,
            in the same manner that other money received by him is charged, and the same shall
            be paid to said purchasers, or their legal representatives when called for, by orders
            drawn by the commissioners of the county upon the treasurer as in other cases.]  20180154u41s  Section 41.  Sections 1762, 1770, 1770.1 and 1771 of the act are amended to read:  Section 1762.  Depositories.--(a)  The county commissioners together with the county treasurer shall, from time to time,
            designate, by resolution, a depository or depositories for all county funds to be
            deposited. Such depository or depositories shall be banks, banking institutions or
            trust companies, located in the Commonwealth.  (b) (1) Depositories so designated shall, upon receipt of notice of their selection as a depository
            of county funds, [furnish a bond to secure payment of deposits and any interest to
            the county, secured by a surety company, or by the depositing in escrow of securities
            to be approved by the county commissioners. The parties may, by agreement, provide
            for substitution of securities so held in escrow, the securities in every case to
            be approved by the commissioners. Such bonds shall be in a sum to be fixed by resolution
            of the county commissioners.] collateralize deposits of public funds in  accordance with the act of August 6, 1971 (P.L.281, No.72),  entitled ""An act standardizing the procedures for pledges of  assets to secure deposits of public funds with banking  institutions pursuant to other laws; establishing a standard  rule for the types, amounts and valuations of assets eligible to  be used as collateral for deposits of public funds; permitting  assets to be pledged against deposits on a pooled basis; and  authorizing the appointment of custodians to act as pledgees of  assets,"" which authorizes financial institutions to pledge  collateral in an account in the name of the county, or utilize a  letter of credit from the Federal Home Loan Bank, to secure  public deposits in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation insurance limits. The depository shall provide a  monthly report within fifteen days after the end of each month  to the commissioners in accordance with the reporting  requirements in the act of August 6, 1971 (P.L.281, No.72),  including the composition of the collateral and related market  value.  (2)  Counties may elect to require that any depositories must pledge collateral in an account
            in the name of the county to collateralize deposits above the Federal Deposit Insurance
            Corporation limit. These accounts may be custodied with the depository's trust department
            or at a third-party financial institution. The arrangement with the depository may
            be governed by a written agreement, approved by the board of directors or loan committee
            of the depository, with approval reflected in the minutes of the board or committee,

            to] secure payment of deposits and interest insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
            Corporation.  (c)  The county treasurer shall, upon the designation of such depository or depositories,
            immediately, transfer thereto all county funds to be deposited, and shall, thereafter,
            keep such deposits solely in such depository or depositories in the name of the county.
            Withdrawals from such depository shall be only drawn by the treasurer, upon properly
            authorized checks or by other commercially accepted methods of electronic funds transfer
            which have been specifically approved by the board of commissioners.  (d)  Neither county commissioners nor treasurer complying with the provisions of this [section] article , nor their surety or sureties, shall be chargeable with losses of county funds caused

            adjusted valuation, unless the county commissioners by majority action shall, upon
            due cause shown by resolution, petition the court of common pleas, in which case the
            court may order a rate of not more than five mills additional to be levied: Provided,
            however, That the rate of taxation for payment of interest and principal on any indebtedness
            incurred [pursuant to the act of July 12, 1972 (P.L.781, No.185), known as the ""Local

            exceed the rate of ten mills on every dollar of the adjusted valuation and shall be
            in addition to the twenty-five mill limitation for general county purposes. In fixing
            the rate of taxation, the county commissioners, if the rate is fixed in mills, shall
            also include in the resolution a statement expressing the rate of taxation in dollars

            classes] may levy and collect an annual per capita tax on persons for county purposes.  (3) Any county [of the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh or eighth class] which shall become
            a county of the third class may collect for a period of four years after such status
            has been certified a per capita tax from any person not in any one year to exceed
            a total of five dollars ($5) for county purposes.  (d)  In a county of the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh or eighth class:  (1) No tax shall be levied and collected for county purposes on offices and posts of profits,

            year exceed a total of five dollars ($5) for county and institution district purposes.  (3) Any county may, by ordinance or resolution, exempt any person whose total income from
            all sources is less than [ten thousand dollars ($10,000)] the dollar amount per annum as provided in section 301.1(b) of the act of December 31, 1965 (P.L.1257, No.511), known as ""The Local Tax Enabling Act,"" from any per capita tax levied under this act.

            of a building or buildings not otherwise exempt as a dwelling after January first
            of any year, and such building is not included in the tax duplicate of the county,
            the authority responsible for assessments in the county shall, upon the request of
            the board of county commissioners, cause to be inspected and reassessed, subject to
            the right of appeal and adjustment provided by the act of Assembly under which assessments
            are made, all taxable property in the county to which major improvements have been
            made after January first, and to give notice of such reassessments [within ten days] in accordance with 53 Pa.C.S. §  8841(c) (relating to assessment roll and interim revisions) to the authority responsible for assessments, the county commissioners and the property
            owner. Such property shall then be added to the duplicate and shall be taxable for
            county purposes at the reassessed valuation for that proportionate part of the fiscal
            year of the county remaining after the property was improved. Any improvement made
            during the month shall be computed as having been made on the first of the month.
            A certified copy of the additions or revisions to the duplicate shall be furnished
            by the board of county commissioners to the proper tax collector for the county and,
            within ten days thereafter, the tax collector shall notify the owner of the property
            of the taxes due the county.  Whenever an assessment is made for a portion of a year as above provided, the same
            shall be added to the duplicate of the following or succeeding year unless the value
            of the improvements has already been included in said duplicate.  Section 1771.  Temporary Loans.--Whenever the funds of a county have been exhausted, the county commissioners

            property transferred to the bidder or his assigns at a time during the duration of
            the contract shall be specified in the bid and shall be determined using generally
            accepted valuation methods.  (e)  The acceptance of bids by advertising required herein shall be made by the [commissioners] controller, in the case of  a county of the second class A, or by the commissioners, in the  case of a county of the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh or  eighth class, and shall only be made by public announcement at the meeting at which bids are opened,
            or at a subsequent meeting, the time and place of which shall be publicly announced
            when bids are so opened. If for any reason the award is not made at either of the
            above meetings, the same business may be transacted at any subsequent meeting, the
            time and place of which shall have been announced at the previous meeting held for
            such award. The contract shall be awarded, or all bids shall be rejected, within thirty
            days of the opening of the bids, except for bids subject to 62 Pa.C.S. (relating to
            procurement). Thirty-day extensions of the date for the award may be made by the mutual
            written consent of the commissioners and any bidder who wishes to remain under consideration
            for award. The commissioners shall excuse from consideration any bidder not wishing
            to agree to a request for extension of the date for the award and shall release such
            bidder from any bid bond or similar bid security furnished under subsection (f). All
            contracts shall be filed with the controller, or with the chief clerk as the case
            may be, immediately after their execution.  (f)  The commissioners may require , as a necessary condition  of considering a bid, that any bids advertised be accompanied by [cash, by a certified check,] a cashier's check[, bank good faith check] or other irrevocable letter of credit in
            a reasonable amount drawn upon a bank authorized to do business in this Commonwealth
            or by a bond with corporate surety in a reasonable amount. [Whenever it is required
            that a bid be accompanied by cash, certified check, cashier's check, bank good faith
            check or other irrevocable letter of credit or bond, no bid shall be considered unless
            so accompanied.] In the event any bidder shall, upon award of the contract to [him] the bidder , fail to comply with the requirements [hereinafter stated] of  subsection (g) as to security guaranteeing the performance of the contract, the security furnished
            under this subsection shall be forfeited to the county as liquidated damages.  (g)  [The] Whenever a formal bid is required by this article,  the successful bidder[, when a formal bid is required herein,] may be required to furnish
            a bond or irrevocable letter of credit or other security in an amount sufficient to
            the commissioners guaranteeing performance of the contract within thirty days after
            the contract has been awarded, unless the commissioners shall prescribe a shorter
            period. The successful bidder for a contract which involves the construction, erection,
            installation, completion, alteration, repair of or addition to any public work or
            improvement of any kind shall furnish security as provided in section 2318 of this
            act. Performance security for services and contracts for labor and materials delivered
            on a periodic basis, including, but not limited to, food service contracts, home health
            services and janitorial services and supplies, may be computed on the expected average
            value for one or more months at the discretion of the commissioners. Upon failure
            to furnish such security within the time fixed, the previous awards shall be void.
            Deliveries, performances and guarantees may be required in all cases of expenditures,
            including the exceptions [herein] as under  subsection (h) .  (h)  The contracts or purchases made by the commissioners which shall not require advertising,
            bidding or price quotations, as hereinbefore provided, are as follows:  (1)  Those for maintenance, repairs or replacements for water, electric light, or other
            public works of the county where they do not constitute new additions, extensions
            or enlargements of existing facilities and equipment. Security may be required by
            the commissioners as in other cases for work done.  (2)  Those made for improvements, repairs and maintenance of any kind, made or provided

            appliances, vehicles or parts thereof, are desired by the commissioners, which are

            public utility service and electricity, natural gas or telecommunication services,
            provided that, in the case of utilities not under tariff with the Pennsylvania Public
            Utility Commission, contracts made without advertising and bidding shall be made only

            specified in section 1801(b) of this article.  (5)  Those involving services of members of the medical or legal profession, registered
            architects, engineers, certified public accountants or other personal services involving
            professional expertise.  (6)  Those involving contracts entered into by nonprofit cooperative hospital service associations
            for hospitals and nursing homes which are part of the institutional district or which

            loan of any supplies or materials to the county by a public body, provided that the
            price thereof shall not be in excess of that fixed by the public body. The requirements
            of 53 Pa.C.S. Ch. 23 Subch. A (relating to intergovernmental cooperation) shall not
            apply when a county purchases cooperatively with another public body which has entered
            into a contract for supplies or materials. As used in this paragraph, ""public body""
            shall mean any of the following:  (i)  the Federal Government;  (ii)  the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania;  (iii)  any other state;  (iv)  a political subdivision, local or municipal authority , council of government, entity created in accordance with 53 Pa.C.S.

            technology and information systems on the basis of best value procurement. Contracts
            under best value procurement shall be made only after the county has solicited proposals
            based on performance and outcome specifications developed by the county and describing
            at minimum the objectives to be met by the system, the tasks to be performed by the
            system, the users of the system, system security issues, the time frame for system
            implementation, potential operating technologies, compatibility with existing systems,
            training and maintenance and shall indicate the process by which the contract shall
            be awarded. Best value procurement shall not require a sealed bid process and shall
            permit the commissioners to negotiate the terms of the agreement with any responsive
            and responsible vendor.  (j)  Every contract subject to this article shall comply, as applicable, with the provisions
            of [the] :  (1)  The act of August 15, 1961 (P.L.987, No.442), known as the ""Pennsylvania Prevailing

            (P.L.9, No.4), referred to as the Public Contract Bid Withdrawal Law, and the act
            of April 4, 1984 (P.L.193, No.40), known as the ""Motor Vehicle Procurement Act].""  (5)  The act of February 17, 1994 (P.L.73, No.7), known as the ""Contractor and Subcontractor
            Payment Act.""  (6)  62 Pa.C.S. Chs. 37 Subch. B. (relating to motor vehicles), 39 (relating to contracts

            or fees shall be made to the board of commissioners.  (2)  The board of commissioners must approve the sharing of any fee or compensation for
            personal or professional services prior to the performance of said services.  (3)  No fee or compensation for personal or professional services may be shared except
            for work actually performed.  (4)  No shared fee or compensation for personal or professional services may be paid at
            a rate in excess of that commensurate for similar personal or professional services.  Section 1803.  Evasion of Advertising Requirements.--(a)  No commissioner or commissioners shall evade the provisions of section one thousand
            eight hundred two of this act, as to advertising for bids or purchasing or contracting
            for services and personal properties piece-meal, for the purpose of obtaining prices
            under the base amount of eighteen thousand five hundred dollars ($18,500), subject
            to adjustment under section 1801(b.1), upon transactions which should in the exercise
            of reasonable discretion and prudence be conducted as one transaction amounting to
            more than the base amount of eighteen thousand five hundred dollars ($18,500), subject
            to adjustment under section 1801(b.1). This provision is intended to make unlawful
            the practice of evading advertising requirements by making a series of purchases or
            contracts each for less than the advertising requirement price, or by making several
            simultaneous purchases or contracts each below said price, when in either case the
            transaction involved should have been made as one transaction for one price. Any [county
            commissioners]  commissioner who so [vote] votes in violation of this provision and who know that the transaction upon which they
            so vote is or ought to be a part of a larger transaction and that it is being divided
            in order to evade the requirements as to advertising for bids shall be, jointly and
            severally, subject to surcharge for any loss sustained. Wherever it shall appear that
            a commissioner may have voted in violation of this section, but the purchase or contract
            on which he so voted was not approved by the board of [county] commissioners, this
            section shall be inapplicable.  (b)  Any [county] commissioner who votes to unlawfully evade the provisions of section
            [one thousand eight hundred two] 1802 of this act and who knows that the transaction upon which he so votes is or ought
            to be a part of a larger transaction and that it is being divided in order to evade
            the requirements as to advertising for bids commits a misdemeanor of the third degree
            for each contract entered into as a direct result of that vote. This penalty shall
            be in addition to any surcharge which may be assessed pursuant to subsection (a).  Section 1805.  Sales of Personal Property and Surplus Farm Products.--(a)  No personal property [of the county] and no surplus farm products [of counties of
            the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh or eighth classes] of the county shall be disposed of by sale or otherwise, except upon resolution of the commissioners.
            When the commissioners approve a sale of such property or [in counties of the fourth,
            fifth, sixth, seventh or eighth classes of] farm products, they shall estimate the
            sale value of the entire lot to be disposed of, and, if the estimate be less than
            [one thousand dollars ($1,000)] two thousand dollars ($2,000) , they shall require notice of the proposed sale to be posted, for at least ten days,
            in a prominent place in the court house, describing and itemizing the property to
            be sold, and directing that bids may be made thereon at the office of the chief clerk
            of the commissioners. Thereafter, the commissioners may sell such property in whole
            or in part for the best price or prices obtainable.  (b)  If the commissioners estimate the sale value of the personal property or of such surplus
            farm products to be sold at [one thousand dollars ($1,000)] two thousand dollars ($2,000) or more, the entire lot shall be advertised for sale, once, in at least one newspaper
            of general circulation in the county, and sale of the property so advertised shall
            be made to the highest and best bidder. The bids shall not be opened until at least
            ten days after the said advertisement. The commissioners may sell any such property
            at auction, but the provisions as to notice contained in this section shall be likewise
            observed as to the holding of auction sales. The provisions of this section shall
            not be mandatory where county property is to be traded-in or exchanged for new personal
            property. The provisions of this section shall not apply to sale of personal property
            with real property as a single unit pursuant to section 2306.1.  (c)  A public auction of personal property may be conducted by means of an online or electronic
            auction sale. During an electronic auction sale, bids shall be accepted electronically
            at the time and in the manner designated in the advertisement. During the electronic
            auction, each bidder shall have the capability to view the bidder's bid rank or the
            high bid price. Bidders may increase bid prices during the electronic auction. The
            record of the electronic auction shall be accessible as a public record under the
            provisions of the act of February 14, 2008 (P.L.6, No.3), known as the ""Right-to-Know
            Law."" The purchase price shall be paid by the high bidder immediately or at a reasonable
            time after the conclusion of the electronic auction as determined by the commissioners.
            In the event that shipping costs are incurred, the shipping costs shall be paid by
            the high bidder. A county that has complied with the advertising requirements of this
            section may provide additional notice of the sale by bids or public auction in any
            manner deemed appropriate by the commissioners. The advertisement for electronic auction
            sales authorized in this subsection shall include the publicly accessible Internet
            website or means of accessing the electronic auction and the date, time and duration
            of the electronic auction.  Section 1806.  County Officers Not to Be Interested in Contracts , Generally .--[Restrictions] (a)  Except as provided in subsection (b), restrictions on the involvement of elected and appointed county officers in any county contract
            shall be as prescribed in 65 Pa.C.S. Ch. 11 (relating to ethics standards and financial
            disclosure)[.] and subject to the limitations and procedures under section 1802(k).  (b)  Notwithstanding subsection (a), the following shall apply:  (1)  It shall be unlawful for any architect or engineer, in the employ of any county of
            the second class A, and engaged in the preparation of plans, specifications or estimates,
            to bid or negotiate on any public work at any letting of work by the county, except
            that an architect or engineer who shall have prepared preliminary plans only shall
            not be prohibited from bidding or negotiating on the final contract for the work.  (2)  It shall be unlawful for the officers of any county of the second class A charged
            with the duty of letting any public work, to award a contract to an architect or engineer,
            in the employ of the county who is in any way interested in a contract for public
            work for the county or for any architect or engineer to receive any remuneration or
            gratuity from any person interested in the contract except under the terms and conditions
            as provided in section 1802(k).  (3)  Any person violating any of the provisions of paragraph (1) or (2) shall be guilty
            of a misdemeanor in office and, upon conviction, shall forfeit the office and be sentenced
            to pay a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars ($500), or to undergo imprisonment
            for not more than six months, or both.  Section 1807.  Application of Contract Provisions.--The provisions of this article shall apply to
            all the contractual powers of the [county] commissioners contained in this act, or
            other laws insofar as they are not inconsistent therewith, and the mention of powers
            of contract outside this article shall not be construed as being in disregard of the
            applicable provisions of this article in relation thereto.  20180154u50s  Section 50.  The act is amended by adding sections to read:  Section 1807.1.  Printing Contracts in Certain Counties.--In counties of the second class A, the commissioners
            may, by proper resolution, require that printing firms presenting bids for county
            printing shall establish consideration as responsible bidders by requiring:  (1)  That the printing firms shall file, with the chief clerk of the commissioners, a sworn
            statement to the effect that employes, in the employ of the firm or firms which are
            to produce the printing, are receiving the prevailing wage rate and are working under
            conditions prevalent in the locality in which the work is produced.  (2)  That whenever a collective bargaining agreement shall be in effect between an employer
            and employes who are represented by a responsible organization which is in no way
            influenced or controlled by the management, the agreement and the provisions of the
            agreement shall be considered as conditions prevalent in the locality and shall be
            the minimum requirements for being adjudged a responsible bidder under this act.  (3)  That in case any dispute arises as to what is the prevailing rate of wages for work
            applicable to the contract, which cannot be adjusted by the commissioners, the matter
            shall be referred to the county salary board and the board's decision shall be conclusive.  (4)  The words ""prevailing wage rate,"" as used in this section, shall be construed to mean
            at least the minimum wages which are received by employes of any printing firm or
            firms, in second class A counties, as a result of collective bargaining agreements
            negotiated by an employer or employers with a responsible organization representing
            the employes. If the wage rates, so arrived at, vary in any district in a county,
            then any printing firm which pays wages at least equal to those provided for in any
            of such agreements, shall, for the purposes of this act, be deemed to be paying the
            prevailing wage rate.  Section 1807.2.  Certain Contract Provisions Prohibited.--No political subdivision or authority in
            a county of the second class A may enter into any contract related to a redevelopment
            capital assistance project as provided under section 318 of the act of February 9,
            1999 (P.L.1, No.1), known as the ""Capital Facilities Debt Enabling Act,"" which contains
            a provision requiring that a specified percentage of a contracting party's work force
            be residents of a specific municipality.  20180154u51s  Section 51.  Subdivisions (a), (b) and (c) of Article XIX of the act are repealed:  [(a)  Appropriations for Military Purposes  Section 1901.  Appropriation of Money or Land for National Guard Armories.--(a)  The board of commissioners may, either independently or in connection with any other

            the State of Pennsylvania in the erection, wherever deemed most advantageous by the
            Armory Board, of armories for the use of the National Guard of Pennsylvania. The board

            inspection provided by law. The moneys so appropriated shall be used and expended
            solely and exclusively for the support and maintenance, discipline and training, of
            the said company, battalion, regiment or similar organization, and the commanding
            officer shall account, by proper vouchers to the said county each year, for the expenditure

            counties, or answer any call of the Governor of the Commonwealth.  (b)  No moneys shall be appropriated to any such club, unless practice on such rifle-range

(b)  Burial of Deceased Service Persons  and Surviving Spouses  Section 1908.  Definitions.--(a)  The term deceased service person, as used in this subsection, shall mean and include:  (1)  Any deceased person who, at the time of his or her death, was serving (whether or
            not in a combat zone) in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, or
            any women's organization officially connected therewith, during any war or armed conflict
            in which the United States has been, is now or shall hereafter be engaged, or who,
            at the time of his or her death, was serving in a zone where a campaign or state or
            condition of war or armed conflict then existed, in which the United States was, is
            or shall be a participant. The existence of a campaign or state or condition of war
            or armed conflict, and the participation of the United States therein, as well as
            the fact that the deceased person served in a zone where such campaign or state or
            condition of war or armed conflict existed, shall, in each case, be established by
            the records of the Department of Defense of the Federal Government; or  (2)  Any deceased person, who had so served at any time during his or her life, and whose
            separation from such service was honorable, whether by discharge or otherwise, or
            who at the time of his or her death was continuing in such service after the cessation
            of the war, armed conflict, campaign or state or condition of war during or in which
            he or she served; or  (3)  Any deceased person who was in active service in the militia of the State of Pennsylvania
            under and in pursuance of any proclamation issued by the Governor during the Civil
            War, who was not duly mustered into the service of the United States, but was honorably
            discharged or relieved from such service.  (b)  The term ""legal residence"" as used in this subsection, shall be construed as synonymous
            with ""domicile"" and is hereby defined as actual residence, coupled with intention
            that it shall be permanent, or a residence presently fixed with no definite intention
            of changing it, or of returning to a former residence at some future period. Legal
            residence is to be determined by abode of person and his or her intention to abandon
            his or her former domicile and establish a new one. The legal residence of a deceased
            service person shall be prima facia in the county where he or she made his or her
            abode at the time of his or her death.  Section 1909.  Funeral Expenses of Deceased Service Persons.--(a)  Any county is hereby authorized and directed to contribute the sum of seventy-five

            where in each case application therefor is made within one year after the date of
            his or her death. In the case of any deceased service person who died while in the
            service, application need not be made within one year after the date of his or her
            death, but may be made at any time thereafter.  (b)  Payments shall be made under the following circumstances:  (1)  Where the deceased service person at the time of his or her death had his or her legal
            residence in the county, whether or not he or she died in the county, and whether
            or not he or she was buried in the county. It is hereby declared to be the intent
            of the General Assembly that every deceased service person having a legal residence
            in this Commonwealth at the time of his or her death shall be entitled to the benefits
            of this section, regardless of where he or she may have died or where he or she may
            be buried, and that the liability therefor shall be on the county, where the deceased
            service person shall have had his or her legal residence at the time of his or her
            death.  (2)  Where the deceased service person died and was buried in the county, but at the time
            of his of her death did not have legal residence within this Commonwealth, if the
            county commissioners of the county where he or she died are notified in writing by
            any organization of veterans that the body is unclaimed by relatives or friends, and
            upon investigation shall find such condition to exist.  (3)  Where a deceased service person has died while a member of the Pennsylvania Soldiers'
            and Sailors' Home at Erie, Pennsylvania, and such home incurs all funeral expenses
            and buries the soldier in a cemetery in the City of Erie, Pennsylvania, or the home
            furnishes clothing, casket and shipping case, and ships the body to the county from
            which he was admitted to the home, the county from which he was admitted shall reimburse
            and pay to the Pennsylvania Soldiers' and Sailors' Home the amount of seventy-five
            dollars ($75) or so much thereof as was actually expended by the home.  Section 1910.  Burial of Spouses of Deceased Service Persons.--Upon due application and proof, the
            county is hereby authorized and directed to contribute the sum of seventy-five dollars
            ($75) and may contribute an additional sum of twenty-five dollars ($25) from the county
            funds towards the funeral expenses of any spouse of any deceased service person, who
            at the time of his or her death had a legal residence in the county, whether or not
            he or she died in the county and whether or not he or she was buried in the county.
            The county shall not contribute any moneys toward the funeral expenses of any spouse
            of a deceased service person who had remarried after the death of such deceased service
            person, nor unless application for the payment of such moneys shall be made within
            one year after the date of the death of such spouse.  Section 1911.  Payment.--(a)  It shall be the duty of the county to cause a voucher check to be drawn upon the treasury

            in accordance with the provisions of this subdivision, to be paid out of the funds
            of the county, and such checks shall be made payable to the applicant or applicants
            if the application shows that the funeral expenses have been paid, otherwise to the
            undertaker performing the services with notice to the applicant.  (b)  Application for such contribution shall be made by the personal representative of
            such deceased service person or deceased service person's spouse, if there be such
            personal representative, and if no such personal representative has qualified then
            by any next of kin, individual, or veterans' organization, who or which assumes responsibility
            for the cost of burial of the body. The application shall be sustained by affidavit
            as to the facts.  (c)  The application shall be on forms prescribed by the Department of Military Affairs
            and shall set forth whether or not the funeral expenses have been paid. The application
            shall have attached thereto a certified copy of the death certificate and a certification
            by the undertaker, who had charge of the burial of the body, and to the effect that
            the undertaker did render such service.  Section 1912.  Notification of County Commissioners.--The coroners and all other public officers,
            agents and servants and all officers, agents and servants of any county, city, township,

            person, notify the county commissioners of the county wherein such death occurred,
            or wherein such deceased service person shall have had his legal residence.  Section 1913.  Markers for Graves; Headstones.--(a)  The county commissioners of each county shall, from time to time as they consider
            expedient, procure appropriate markers for the graves of deceased service persons
            and the graves of all other deceased persons who served in the Army, Navy, Air Force,
            Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Merchant Marine during World War II or any organization
            officially connected therewith and whose separation from such service was honorable,
            whether by discharge or otherwise. Such markers shall be of cast bronze, aluminum
            or a suitable substitute material.  (b)  The county commissioners shall procure bronze, aluminum or suitable substitute material
            markers from some manufacturer or manufacturers, engaged in the manufacturing of the
            same, and in the contract for the furnishing thereof, the manufacturer furnishing
            the bronze markers shall warrant that the same are made of the following metals, and
            in the following proportions: copper, eighty-five per centum; tin, five per centum;
            zinc, five per centum; and lead, five per centum.  (c)  The manufacturer shall be liable to the county to an amount equal to the sum paid
            to him by the county for the markers, if the above proportions of metals are not contained
            in the markers.  (d)  Nothing, except actual fraud on the part of the county commissioners, shall render
            them liable for any amount if it is established that the markers are not composed
            of the metals in the proportions above recited.  (e)  No officer, trustee, association, corporation or person in control of any cemetery,
            or a public burying ground, shall have the right to question the composition of such
            bronze markers, or to require that any of them be chemically analyzed before being
            placed in the cemetery, or under any circumstances to refuse to permit the erection
            thereof in the cemetery, or public burying ground, or to charge for making the foundations
            for the same more than is charged for making similar foundations of the same proportion.
            Any person who violates any of the provisions of this subsection shall, upon conviction
            thereof in a summary proceeding, be sentenced to pay a fine of not less than ten dollars
            ($10) nor more than one hundred dollars ($100) for each offense.  (f)  The county commissioners of each county are hereby authorized and directed to place
            a marker upon the grave of each deceased service person and the graves of all other
            deceased persons who served in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard,
            Merchant Marine during World War II or any organization officially connected therewith
            and whose separation from such service was honorable, whether by discharge or otherwise,
            who, at the time of his or her death, had his or her legal residence in the county,
            whether or not he or she died in the county, and whether or not he or she was buried
            in the county, and upon the grave of each deceased service person buried in the county,
            who at the time of his or her death did not have a legal residence within this Commonwealth.
            When such deceased service person shall have been a veteran of any war or campaign
            for which the Government of the United States issued discharge buttons, the markers
            designated for their graves shall include a facsimile of said discharge button. When
            such markers are upright flag holders they shall consist of cast bronze or any other
            weather resistant material. When such deceased service person shall have been a veteran
            of the Korean Conflict, the markers designated for their graves shall include a circular
            emblem with the words ""Korea, U.S., 1950-1953"" in the border thereof, and shall incorporate
            the insignia of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Coast Guard, in the form
            approved by the State Veterans' Commission.  (g)  It shall be the duty of the county commissioners of each county, upon or at any time
            subsequent to the death of any deceased service person and the graves of all other
            deceased persons who served in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard,
            Merchant Marine during World War II or any organization officially connected therewith
            and whose separation from such service was honorable, whether by discharge or otherwise,
            who, at the time of his or her death, had his or her legal residence in the county,
            on application as hereinafter provided, to cause a headstone or bronze memorial tablet
            to be placed at the head of or on the grave of each such deceased service person.  (h)  Each headstone shall contain his or her name and the rank and organization to which
            he or she belonged or in which he or she served, in letters raised or cut in at least
            three-sixteenth of an inch deep. The headstone shall be of either marble or granite,
            and shall be placed or set in a concrete base at least three feet deep, or if a headstone
            has been provided for such grave by the United States Government, the county commissioners
            shall provide the concrete base therefor, or if lettering only on an existing memorial
            is desired by the family, the county commissioners shall provide such lettering.  (i)  In the event the body of any deceased service person either cannot or will not be
            returned to the United States of America, it shall be the duty of the county commissioners
            to cause a headstone to be placed in the family plot of such deceased service person.
            Said headstone shall have inscribed thereon, (1) the name, rank and organization of
            such deceased service person, (2) the name of the country, location or manner in which
            such person lost his or her life, and (3) the cemetery or location in which the body,
            if buried, was finally laid to rest. Application therefor shall in each case be made
            on forms prescribed by the Department of Military Affairs and may be made by any relative
            of the deceased service person, or by a friend if there is no objection by the nearest
            relative. Each application must be approved by an organization of veterans of any
            war in which the United States has been, is now or shall hereafter be engaged.  (j)  The expense in each case shall be borne by the county in which the deceased service
            person had his or her legal residence at the time of his or her death, whether or
            not he or she died in the county, and whether or not he or she was buried in the county.
            The expense shall not exceed the sum of one hundred dollars ($100) for each headstone
            or concrete base or lettering or bronze memorial tablet and the county commissioners
            of each county, acting under this section, shall cause to be drawn a voucher check
            on the treasury of the county for the payment of said expense in favor of the party
            or parties furnishing such headstone or concrete base or lettering or bronze memorial
            tablet.  (k)  In cases of dispute concerning the legal residence of a deceased service person, the
            county in which a deceased service person is buried shall perform the duties hereinbefore
            set forth. No such payment or payments shall be made, unless the application therefor
            shall be approved before the commencement of the project by the county commissioners.  (l)  Any person who shall wilfully, maliciously, or carelessly destroy, mutilate, remove
            or deface any grave marker, headstone or flag holder, placed or erected under the
            provisions of this section, shall be guilty of the grade of offense in relation to
            the dollar amount of the theft or damage done in accordance with 18 Pa.C.S. § 3903
            (relating to grading of theft offenses).  Section 1914.  Burial Plots.--The county commissioners of the several counties are hereby authorized
            to purchase plots of ground, in any cemetery or burial ground in their respective
            counties, for the interment of deceased service persons whose bodies are entitled
            to be buried under the provisions of this subdivision, and to cause to be drawn a
            voucher check upon their county treasury for the payment of the same. The purchase
            price of said plots of ground shall not be charged against or allotted as part of
            the cost of burial of such deceased service persons who may be buried in any of said
            plots under the provisions of this subdivision.  Section 1915.  Care of Graves and Markers.--The county commissioners of each county shall, at all
            times, see that the graves and tombstones of all deceased service persons who are
            buried in such county, receive proper and fitting care, and may employ all necessary
            assistants to carry out the provisions of this section. The expense of the care of
            such graves and tombstones shall be borne by the county where said graves are located,
            except where suitable care is otherwise provided. Money so appropriated may be expended
            directly by the county commissioners, or paid over to the person, firm, association
            or corporation owning or controlling any cemetery or burial place in the county where
            any such grave is situated. The sum so paid over in any year shall not exceed for
            each grave the charge for the annual care and maintenance of like graves in the same
            cemetery, or, if no such fixed charge is established in that cemetery, it shall not
            exceed the sum charged in other cemeteries in the same county for like service.  Section 1916.  Proof of Service, Et Cetera.--(a)  In each case, where application is made for a contribution toward the funeral expenses
            of a deceased service person, or the surviving spouse of a deceased service person,
            or for a headstone or concrete base or lettering or bronze memorial tablet, the county
            commissioners shall, before expending any money therefor, require proof of the following
            facts:  (1)  The service of the deceased service person which entitles him or his surviving spouse
            to the benefits of this subdivision. Such proof shall be by the production of an honorable

            Government, or by copies thereof filed in the Department of Military Affairs showing
            the existence of a campaign or state or condition of war, the participation of the
            United States therein, and the service of the deceased service person in a zone where
            such campaign or state or condition of war existed.  (2)  The death of the deceased service person.  (3)  In the case of the burial of the surviving spouse of a deceased service person, the
            death of such surviving spouse, and the fact that the spouse was married to the deceased
            service person at the time of his death, and that the spouse has not since remarried.
            The proof required by clauses one and two of this subsection shall also be required
            in such cases.  (4)  Except in cases where persons not having a legal residence within this Commonwealth
            are entitled to any of the benefits of this subdivision, the legal residence within
            the county of the deceased service person, or of the surviving spouse of a deceased
            service person, as the case may be.  (b)  Death shall in all cases be proved by death certificate where the same is procurable,
            otherwise by affidavit of one or more persons personally acquainted with the deceased,
            and the fact of his or her death, or by proof of the record of death kept by the attending
            physician, or by proof of the record of burial kept by the undertaker by whom he or
            she was buried, or by the church burial association or cemetery company maintaining
            the graveyard, burial ground or cemetery in which he or she was buried.  (c)  Where any proof required by this subdivision has been furnished to the county commissioners,
            no further proof of the same facts shall be required in order to obtain any other
            benefit under the provisions of this subdivision.  (c)  Memorial Observances  Section 1921.  Appropriations to Veterans' Organizations for Expenses of Memorial Day, Veterans'

            custodial parent if the parents do not live together or other legal guardian if neither
            parent has custody of the child has an established settlement elsewhere, in which
            case the first settlement of such person is in the county of his or her custodian.
            If the child resides with both parents and they have different settlements the settlement
            of the child shall be the same as that of the parent whose settlement coincides with
            the family residence. If neither parent's settlement coincides with the family residence,
            the child's settlement shall be in the place of the child's birth.  (3)  The settlement of a person in a county continues until a new one is acquired in this
            Commonwealth or elsewhere. A settlement is lost only by acquiring a new one, except
            that a person who has settlement in this Commonwealth, and who is residing in another
            state, shall be deemed to have lost settlement in this Commonwealth if a person from
            such other state, in like circumstances, could have acquired settlement in this Commonwealth
            by residence in this Commonwealth, as hereinafter provided; and except that a person
            having settlement in this Commonwealth, who has been absent therefrom and who has
            been residing in another state, shall be deemed to have lost settlement in this Commonwealth
            if a resident of such other state, who is residing in this Commonwealth, would lose
            settlement in such other state as a result of absence therefrom for a period of equal
            duration or for a period of lesser duration.  (4)  Except as hereinafter otherwise provided, every adult and every emancipated minor,
            whether married or single, may acquire a new settlement in any county of this Commonwealth
            or in the Commonwealth by coming bona fide to establish a permanent abode therein
            and continuing to reside therein for one whole year, if such person or minor is of
            sufficient mental ability to make a bargain, and is not or does not become a public
            charge during such year.  (6)  A minor cannot be emancipated before age sixteen, and becomes emancipated absolutely
            at age eighteen, if then of sufficient mental ability to make a bargain. After age
            sixteen and before age eighteen, a minor of sufficient mental ability to make a bargain
            may become emancipated by his own acts or the acts of the parent, stepfather or stepmother
            having had the custody. When a person is emancipated, he or she is capable of establishing
            a new settlement.  (7)  A minor who is so mentally deficient as to be unable to make a bargain cannot be emancipated
            after age sixteen, and such a person does not become emancipated at age eighteen and
            so long thereafter, as the mental condition continues. The settlement of such a person
            shall at all times during mental disability be ascertained as provided in clauses
            (8) and (9) of this section for the settlement of minors not emancipated.  (8)  Before emancipation, the settlement of a minor is and remains that of the natural
            parents or custodial parent, should the natural parents not live together, or of any
            other legal guardian, or if the parents live together and have different settlements,
            that of the natural parent whose settlement coincides with the family residence, except
            that if the parents live together with the child and have different settlements neither
            of which coincides with the family residence, the settlement of a minor before emancipation
            shall be and remain in the place of the child's birth.  (10)  If a person has no known settlement in this Commonwealth and cannot for any reason
            whatever be removed into the state or country where settled, he shall have a quasi-settlement
            in the county where he or she becomes a public charge, which county shall, if he be
            a dependent, be liable for his or her support, otherwise such liability shall be upon
            the Commonwealth.  (11)  If a person becomes a public charge in a county other than the one in which settled,
            such county, if he be a dependent, otherwise the Commonwealth, shall be liable for
            support until the county, state or country of settlement is discovered, and removal
            to such county, state or country takes place. Any county of settlement shall be liable
            to the county in which the person became a dependent for the cost of care advanced
            and the expenses of removal.  Section 2176.  Removal to County of Settlement.--In case any person does not have a settlement in
            the county of the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh or eighth class wherein he has become,
            or is likely to become, a dependent, it shall be the duty of the county commissioners
            to notify the county commissioners of the county of his settlement of the facts. If
            the county commissioners, so notified, refuse or neglect to receive him or to make
            arrangements for his proper care and to pay the amount advanced, the county commissioners
            during such care may apply to the court of quarter sessions of their county, or to
            any judge thereof, by petition, asking for a citation to the county commissioners,
            so refusing or neglecting, requiring them to appear before such court at a time specified
            therein, and to show cause why an order should not issue for the removal of such dependent
            into their county. The court shall proceed to hear and determine the cause upon its
            merits, and its decree shall be final, unless an appeal therefrom be taken within
            thirty days.  The citation accompanied by a copy of the petition shall be served by the sheriff
            of the county, who may, for that purpose, deputize the sheriff of the cited county,
            upon one or more of the county commissioners named therein, or, with the approval
            of the court, service may be had by sending such copy by registered mail. The service
            of mailing shall be at least ten days before the day fixed for such hearing. Upon
            the hearing and argument before the court, it shall be lawful for either of the parties
            to the issue to except to any decision of the court upon any point of evidence or
            law, which exception shall be noted by the court and filed of record as in civil cases.
            An appeal to an appellate court may be taken by either party from the judgment or
            decree of the court.  Section 2177.  Liability for Costs.--In case an order of removal is granted by any court of quarter
            sessions, the court, in the same order, shall require the county of settlement to
            pay the petitioners the cost of the proceedings, the expense of removal, and the proper
            charges for the care of the dependent, from the date of the notice first above provided
            for, all of which expense, cost, and charges shall be ascertained and allowed by the
            court. If an order of removal is refused, the cost of the proceeding shall be paid
            by the county petitioning therefor.  The court of quarter sessions shall have full and complete authority and jurisdiction
            to enforce by appropriate methods its orders or directions made in such proceeding.]  20180154u81s  Section 81.  Section 2180 of the act is amended to read:  Section 2180.  Attendance at Training Courses and Conferences.--The commissioners of any county may

            of general circulation in the county once and in accord with the provisions of section
            one hundred ten of this act, of the time and place of their first meeting, and shall

            of the said proposed public improvement.  (c)  All the viewers shall act unless prevented by sickness or other unavoidable cause,
            but a majority of the viewers may hear, determine, pass upon and report all matters
            relating to the view for which they were appointed.  Section 2409.  Time of Appointment of Viewers; Cost.--(a)  The viewers provided for in the preceding section may be appointed either before or

            specifying any judgments, mortgages or other claims (hereinafter designated ""liens"")
            which are liens upon the land and property sought to be appropriated or condemned
            as aforesaid.  Section 2411.  Testimony and Evidence Concerning Liens.--Testimony shall be taken in said proceedings
            to ascertain the amounts of said liens and the dates of the entry of the same, and
            the amounts of said liens and the dates of entry thereof shall be found as facts by
            the viewers in said proceedings. Certified lists of liens from the courts of the Commonwealth
            and the United States shall be prima facie evidence of the existence, dates, amounts,
            dates of entry and places of record of said liens, and unless modified or overcome
            by oral or documentary evidence, shall be conclusive upon the parties thereto.  Section 2412.  Procedure; Rights and Liabilities Where Liens Exist.--When it appears that liens exist
            which are liens upon property sought to be condemned and appropriated, a report of
            the facts found shall be made to the court. Such report shall be subject to exceptions
            in manner to be regulated by the Supreme Court by general rule. When the court has
            finally determined the findings in relation to the liens, the court shall make an
            order directing the payment and distribution of the amount found to be payable as
            compensation to the parties entitled thereto, first to the owners of said liens, then
            to the owners of the property appropriated as aforesaid. The parties interested shall
            have the right of appeal from said order of distribution to the Superior and Supreme
            Courts. Payment in accordance with the order of distribution, evidenced by a receipt
            of record in the proceedings, shall absolutely discharge the party making the payment
            from all liens by any person, copartnership, association or corporation as against
            said property. In such receipt and on the record thereof, any claimant may reserve
            the right to proceed against any other property or assets of the owner of the property
            condemned for any balance due upon his lien.  Section 2413.  Proceedings by and Before Viewers.--The said viewers, having been duly sworn or affirmed
            faithfully, justly and impartially to decide and true report to make concerning all
            matters and things to be submitted to them and in relation to which they are authorized
            to inquire and having viewed the premises and examined the land, property or material
            to be appropriated, injured or destroyed, shall hear all parties interested and their
            witnesses, and, having a due regard to and making just allowance for the advantages
            which may have resulted or which may seem likely to result to the owner or owners
            of said lands or materials in consequence of the proposed improvement, shall estimate,
            determine and assess the damages for the land, property or material taken, injured
            or destroyed, and to whom the same is payable, and the benefits, if any, in connection
            therewith. Having so estimated, determined and assessed the damages and benefits,
            they shall prepare a schedule thereof, and give notice to all parties to whom damages
            are allowed or against whom benefits are assessed of a time, not less than ten days
            thereafter, and of a place, where said viewers shall meet and exhibit said schedule
            and hear all exceptions thereto and evidence.  Section 2414.  Notice of Meeting.--Notice of the time and place of said meeting shall be given in
            the manner provided by law for the service of summons in a personal action upon all
            parties allowed damages and against whom benefits have been assessed, as shown by
            said schedule, if the said parties can be found in the county, or upon an adult person,
            if any, residing upon the property affected in case the owner or reputed owner cannot
            be found, and to all others by publication in the newspaper or newspapers in which
            the first notices of said view were published. When no service is made upon the owner,
            reputed owner or upon an adult person residing upon the property affected, said notice,
            where publication thereof has also been made, shall be deemed to have been properly
            served if tacked or conspicuously posted on the premises. The court may provide by
            whom the notice provided by this act shall be posted, given and served, and fix the
            compensation for said service.  Section 2415.  Plans of Properties Condemned to be Furnished to Viewers.--In all proceedings to assess
            damages for the taking, injury or destruction of private property for public use,
            the county taking, injuring or destroying property for said purpose shall furnish
            the board of viewers with a correct plan of all properties affected, showing all buildings

            names of all owners, tenants or occupiers thereof, the topography of the land and
            the grades and widths of all highways running through or abutting on said properties,
            and all other data necessary for a proper determination of the amount of damages caused
            by the taking, injury or destruction of said private property.  Said plans shall be prepared and ready for the use of the viewers at their first meeting,
            and copies thereof shall be furnished to all owners, tenants and occupiers of the
            property and all other parties affected thereby without charge.  Section 2416.  Report to Court.--After making whatever changes are deemed necessary, the said viewers
            shall make report to the court showing all the damages allowed and benefits assessed
            in each case, and file therewith a plan showing the improvement and the land, properties
            and materials taken, injured or destroyed. When said report is filed, notice thereof
            shall be given by publication once in the newspaper or newspapers in which first notices
            of said view were published. Said notice shall state the date of filing of the report
            and shall contain a schedule of the damages and benefits shown therein, and shall
            further state that, unless exceptions thereto are filed within thirty days from the
            date of filing, the said report will be confirmed absolutely.  Section 2417.  Certain Testimony Authorized.--In all proceedings arising from the exercise of the
            right of eminent domain, it shall be competent for all witnesses called, when duly
            qualified.  (1)  To state in detail and costs all the elements of the property before the exercise
            of the right of eminent domain and as unaffected by it and its market value immediately
            after the exercise of the right of eminent domain and as affected thereby.  (2)  To state in detail and costs all the elements of benefit or damage which they have
            taken into consideration in arriving at their opinion.  (3)  In arriving at their opinion as to the market value immediately after the exercise
            of the right of eminent domain, to add to their opinion of the market value before
            such exercise the cost or value of all the elements of benefit or advantage and to
            deduct therefrom all disadvantages or damage in order to arrive at the market value
            after such exercise of the right of eminent domain and as affected thereby.  (4)  In all proceedings to assess damages or benefits for the opening of any road or highway,
            to take into consideration as one of the elements of advantage or disadvantage the
            cost of highway improvements.  Section 2418.  Value of Property.--In all claims for damages against a county arising from the exercise
            of the right of eminent domain, it shall be competent for the party or parties claiming
            damages to offer in evidence the value of the property affected as assessed for the
            purpose of taxation.  Section 2419.  Unlawful Assessments.--In all cases of appropriation of land for public use, other
            than for roads or highways, it shall be unlawful to assess any portion of the damage
            done to or value of the land so appropriated against the other property adjoining
            or in the vicinity of the land so appropriated.  Section 2420.  Vacation of Road When No Property is Taken.--Whenever viewers are appointed to vacate
            any road or highway and the vacation of the same takes no land from the owner abutting
            thereon, if, in the opinion of the viewers, such vacation damages the property of
            the abutting owner, they may award damages to such owner as though land has been actually
            taken.  Section 2421.  Procedure When Building is on Line of Proposed Road.--Whenever in locating, relocating,
            opening, widening, straightening or extending any road or highway or parts thereof
            the same shall be found to pass through, take or injure buildings, barns or other
            valuable improvements thereon, the said viewers or a majority of them shall have the
            right to recommend that such buildings and improvements, situate in part or in whole
            on the road or highway so to be improved, opened, widened, straightened or extended,
            shall be permitted to remain thereon for such time as shall be deemed wise and proper,
            and if the court shall approve the finding and report of said viewers or a majority
            of them, the owner or owners of such buildings or improvements may continue to use
            and enjoy the same during the time so fixed and determined. In case of the destruction,
            vacation or abandonment of any such building within the time they are so authorized
            to remain, such owners or owner shall not have the right to re-erect and reconstruct

            due to the appropriation, injury or destruction of land, property and materials shall
            make their reports within a time which the court shall fix when so appointing them.
            If the viewers so appointed shall, for any reason appearing sufficient to the court,
            be unable to file their report within the period so fixed, the court may, either before
            or after the expiration of the time fixed, extend the time for the filing of such
            report.  Section 2425.  Payment of Damages and Costs; Interest on Awards.--All damages agreed upon or awarded
            and all costs and expenses incurred shall be paid by the county, except in cases where
            an appeal is taken by any party in interest from the award of the viewers and the
            appellant does not recover any greater amount than the viewers award, in which case
            the appellant shall pay all costs of such appeal.  The amount of damages allowed in a report of viewers for the taking, injury or destruction
            of property by the exercise of the right of eminent domain shall, as finally confirmed,
            bear interest at the rate of six per cent per annum from the date of the final decree.  Section 2426.  Collection of Awards.--Upon the final confirmation of the report of the viewers, the
            party or parties to whom an award has been made shall have the right to take such
            further appropriate legal proceedings as may be necessary and proper to enforce payment
            of said confirmed award, either in nature of a writ of mandamus, execution or otherwise.  Section 2427.  Title to Vest upon Payment of Award.--(a)  Upon payment of the compensation for land or property in accordance with the order
            of distribution, title to such land or property shall vest in the county in accordance
            with provisions of the law under which the appropriation is made, and all claims for
            compensation shall be deemed paid and satisfied.  (b)  In counties of the third and fourth classes upon payment of the compensation for land
            or property in accordance with the order of distribution or upon the filing of a bond
            by such county of the third or fourth class in an amount which shall be fixed by the
            court having jurisdiction, which amount shall not be less than the amount fixed by
            the viewers as the value of the land or property, title to such land or property shall
            vest in the respective third or fourth class county in accordance with provisions
            of the law under which the appropriation is made, and all claims for compensation
            shall be deemed paid and satisfied, except where title vests by virtue of a bond having
            been filed, seventy-five per centum of the amount of damages as fixed by the viewers
            as the value of the land or property shall be paid to the owner within six months
            after the date of the filing of the bond and the balance due shall be determined by
            judicial proceedings and promptly paid thereafter.  Section 2428.  Money to be Paid Into Court in Case of Adverse Claims.--(a)  If any person or persons shall claim adversely to each other any estate or interest
            in the land, property or materials selected by the board of commissioners to be appropriated,
            injured or destroyed for the purposes mentioned in this act, and the viewers shall
            not be able to determine who are the owner or owners of said land, property or materials,
            or the value of their estates and interests therein, they shall so report, valuing
            the land, property or materials as a whole, and upon the confirmation by the court
            of the report of said viewers, if no appeal shall be taken therefrom, the commissioners
            of the county shall pay into the court the whole of the said valuation money; thereupon,
            the title of the land, property or material and the estates and interests of all the
            owners thereof shall become vested in fee in the county acquiring and taking said
            land, property or materials.  (b)  The court of common pleas shall, by rule, process or motion, require all said claimants
            to appear therein and may, by an issue framed between them to be tried by a jury or
            by a reference to a master or by such orders and decisions as shall appear to be just
            under all the circumstances of the case, determine the estates and interest of said
            claimants in said valuation money. Upon the final determination of such proceeding,
            the court shall direct said valuation money to be paid to the person or persons ascertained
            to be entitled thereto.  Section 2429.  Appeals by Adverse Claimants.--(a)  In case any of said claimants shall appeal from the award of said viewers, the county
            commissioners, upon filing in the court and having approved thereby a bond in double
            amount of said award to the said owners and claimants for the benefit of the persons
            owning said land, property or materials, with at least two sufficient sureties conditioned
            for the payment by the county of such an amount as the owner or owners shall be entitled
            to receive for said ground when the same shall have been finally ascertained by due
            course of law, may lawfully enter upon and take possession of said land, property
            or materials.  (b)  The said court shall thereupon proceed to determine the estates and interest of said
            claimants in said land, property or material, as is hereinbefore provided when the
            valuation money is paid into court. Said proceeding shall be finally determined before
            the issue framed upon the said appeal shall be tried, and if it be determined that
            the party appellant has no estate or interest in said land, property or materials,
            his appeal shall be disallowed.  Section 2430.  Payment into Court When Award is Refused or When Parties Cannot be Found.--Any amount
            of money awarded, as herein provided, if refused by the person or persons entitled
            thereto, or if the person or persons entitled thereto cannot be found, shall be paid
            into court, and thereafter all such persons shall look to said fund for all damages
            accruing by reason of the appropriation, injury or destruction of such land, property
            or material.  Section 2431.  Notice to Vacate; Ejectment.--In case any land or property selected by the board of
            commissioners or by the board of commissioners in conjunction and acting with the
            corporate authorities of any city, borough, town or township to be appropriated, injured
            or destroyed, and said land or property has improvements thereon in the actual occupancy
            of any person or persons, and such person has had his, her or their damages assessed
            and paid, thirty days' notice to vacate the same shall be given to the party or parties
            so in actual possession. In case of refusal or neglect on the part of any one to obey
            said notice, the board of commissioners may, at the expiration of said thirty days,
            be entitled to a writ of habere facias possessionem or may enter upon and eject or
            cause to be ejected any of the parties so refusing or neglecting to vacate, and use
            force enough by themselves, agents or employes to accomplish the same.  Section 2432.  Appropriations of Right of Way or Easement.--In any action brought to ascertain or

            highway from one county to another.  Section 2616.  Acceptance of Bridge Donated to County.--(a)  The commissioners of any county may accept, take charge of and enter upon the records
            as a county bridge, any bridge within the county which has been built at the expense
            of private persons or by public subscriptions, and has been opened to free public
            travel, used by the public and become necessary and convenient for the use of the
            public, upon notice in writing of the persons who built it or of the subscribers to
            the original subscription on which the money was raised to build the same, or the
            heirs or assigns of such persons or subscribers, or of a duly authorized board of
            trustees representing such persons or subscribers, that they desire to give the bridge
            to the county in which it is located. Where the bridge crosses the boundary line between two counties, the person or the
               person's heirs or the assignees, subscribers or trustees representing the person shall
               give notice in writing to the county commissioners of each county of the intention
               to donate the bridge to the counties jointly.  (c)  All costs shall be paid out of the treasury of the county. The [county] commissioners
            may require the owner of said bridge to file, together with their notice, a bond sufficient
            to secure payment of the costs.  Section 2633.  Temporary Substitutes for Bridges.--When any county bridge is destroyed or rendered
            impassable, the [county] commissioners may provide at the expense of the county, ferries
            or other temporary ways as a substitute for such destroyed or impassable bridge, until
            such bridge has been rebuilt or rendered fit for public travel. Where [such bridge
            shall have been] the bridge was maintained at the joint expense of two adjoining counties, the establishment and
            maintenance of such ferry or temporary way shall be by joint discretionary action
            of the boards of commissioners of both counties, and the expense thereof shall be
            borne by said counties in the same proportions as the maintenance of [such] the bridge was borne before it was destroyed or rendered impassable.  Section 2634.  Closing, Vacating, Abandoning and Removing County Bridges.--Whenever it appears to
            the [county] commissioners that any county bridge including but not limiting to any
            destroyed or partially destroyed bridge has, from any cause, become burdensome and
            is no longer necessary for the accommodation of public travel, they may close, vacate,
            abandon and remove such bridge.  Section 2635.  Contracts for Special Use of Bridge.--The commissioners [of any county] may enter
            into a contract or lease with any street railway, telegraph or telephone company or
            other public utility, their successors or assigns, desiring to use a county bridge
            and its approaches for other than ordinary public foot or vehicular traffic for the
            concurrent use of such portion of said public bridge and approaches as will not substantially
            impair or restrict the public use and enjoyment thereof, upon such terms and conditions
            as shall be agreed upon, and may charge tolls or rentals for such special use. No
            such contract or lease shall be entered into for a longer period than twenty years
            nor shall any such contract or lease be entered into unless approved by the Public
            Utility Commission or become effective except in accordance with the provisions of
            the Public Utility Law.  Section 2636.  Contracts with Railroad Companies for Use, Purchase, Removal, Replacing or Exchange
            of County Bridge.-- (a) Any railroad company whose tracks or other facilities are located upon any county
            bridge may contract and agree with the commissioners of the county for the use, purchase,
            removal, replacing or exchange of such bridge, or for the compensation to be paid
            to the county by [said] the company for the use and occupancy of the bridge or [such] parts thereof [as may be
            used and occupied by said company. For such purpose the commissioners may contract
            with said company, and may do all acts necessary and proper to carry out such contract
            effectually].  (b) All moneys due and all obligations incurred by said companies under any such contract
            may be collected and enforced in the same manner as debts of like amount are recovered
            and similar obligations enforced in the Commonwealth.  Section 2650.  Procedure for Taking Over Bridge by County; Aid to Political Subdivisions in Construction
            and Maintenance of Bridge.--(a)  Whenever the construction of any new bridge, or of any bridge to replace any existing
            bridge, over a stream, or over or under a railroad, and forming part of any road in
            any city, borough, town or township, or between any two or more [such political subdivisions] municipal corporations is necessary, and requires more expense than it is reasonable that [such political
            subdivision, or any two of them jointly,] the  municipal corporations, individually or jointly, should bear, and if it shall appear to the commissioners [of the county] that such
            bridge is necessary, [and would be too expensive for such political subdivision or
            adjoining political subdivisions to bear, it] the bridge may, at the discretion of the [county] commissioners, be entered on record as a county
            bridge. Such bridge shall thereupon be erected, maintained and kept in repair in the
            same manner as other county bridges constructed under the provisions of subdivision
            (a) of this article.  (b)  If the [county] commissioners refuse to have such bridge entered on record as a county
            bridge, the county may pay the entire cost or any part of the cost of constructing
            such bridge including damages. Such bridge shall thereupon be a municipal [or township]
            bridge to be maintained and kept in repair by such [political subdivision] municipal corporation . The county commissioners may, at their discretion, furnish [such political subdivision] the municipal corporation the whole or any part of the money necessary to maintain such municipal [or township]
            bridge.  (b.1)  The commissioners shall keep a record of all proceedings under this section.  (c)  [Where the cost to the county will not exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000), the
            county commissioners may furnish such aid in the construction of such bridge without
            following the procedure herein stipulated.] In addition to the provisions  of Articles XVIII and XXIII of this act relating to contracting  for services and personal property, whenever the county  commissioners propose to build or repair a bridge upon the line  between the two adjoining counties, required advertising shall  be done in each county, and a copy of the plans and  specifications shall be kept in the commissioner's office of  each county.  Section 2651.  Change in Location of Bridge and Roads.--[When] In counties of the third through eighth class, when such bridge is to take the place of an existing bridge, the viewers may change the
            location thereof so that it may be located and built in the most suitable place, or
            at the least expense, or in the best manner, and, in the case of the change of location
            of such bridge, they shall also report what change in the course or bed of the road
            to be connected therewith will be necessary, and shall also report the vacation of
            the old or existing bridge, and the vacation of such portion of the road connecting
            therewith as they may deem proper.  Section 2652.  Construction of Embankments and Causeways as County Improvements[.--Where] in Certain Counties.--In counties of the third through eighth class, where a stream over which it may be necessary to build a bridge crosses a public road,
            and the building of such bridge requires the construction of an embankment or causeway
            leading to either end of such bridge, the erection of which embankment or causeway
            requires more expense than it is reasonable that one or more adjoining townships should
            bear, [and if it shall appear that for the use and enjoyment of said bridge by the
            public it is necessary to construct an embankment or causeway the construction of
            which would be too expensive for such township or townships to bear, it] the bridge may, in the discretion of the county commissioners, be entered on record as a county
            improvement and constructed as county bridges are constructed.  Section 2653.  Contract for Parts of Municipal Bridges Where County Might Have Built Bridge.--(a)
             Where a [city of the third class, a borough or a township] municipal corporation is authorized to construct a bridge or viaduct over a stream or other place over
            which the county is authorized to build bridges and such [political subdivision] municipal corporation is authorized to contract with the county and with railroads, street railways and
            other companies or parties interested for the building and maintenance of such bridge
            or viaduct and for the payment of any damages caused by the location or building thereof,
            the county commissioners may contract with such [city, borough or township] municipal corporation for that part or portion of the bridge which crosses any of the places hereinbefore
            mentioned, including the abutments and piers thereof. Such part shall thereafter be
            maintained as a county bridge.  (b)  In lieu of the contract above provided for, the county commissioners may contract
            for any part or portion of the whole structure equal to or greater than the part or
            portion which the county might have built.  (c)  The contracts provided for in this section may stipulate that the county shall pay
            a certain portion of the whole contract price or cost of the work, including damages,
            or may stipulate that the county shall construct or pay for the construction of a
            certain part of the work, and may otherwise provide for the payment of the damages.
            The amount to be paid by the county shall be paid directly to the contractor as may
            be provided by the contract. The agreements may also provide for  the maintenance of the viaducts and bridges after their  erection.  20180154u112s  Section 112.  The act is amended by adding a section to read:  Section 2653.1.  Contribution Where County Might Not Have Built Bridge in Certain Counties.--When a
            bridge or viaduct is built by a municipality and does not cross any place over which
            the county is authorized to construct a bridge but crosses merely railroad or railroads
            and private property, the commissioners of counties of the second class A may contract
            to pay an amount of money, not exceeding thirty per centum of the entire cost of the
            proposed bridge or viaduct. The bridge or viaduct shall thereafter be maintained as
            a municipal structure, and the county shall not be liable for any part of the cost
            of maintenance or repair thereof.  20180154u113s  Section 113.  Sections 2655 and 2656 of the act are amended to read:  Section 2655.  Aiding Municipality in Constructing Bridge Over Ravine or Valley.--Whenever different
            parts of any municipality or any two municipalities are separated by an intervening
            valley or ravine, and the commissioners of the county in which such municipality or
            municipalities are located shall decide it necessary that a public bridge, to connect
            the territories thus separated, be constructed, [such] the county may contract with [such] the municipality or municipalities for the laying out and construction of [such] the bridge by such municipality or municipalities, and may pay to the municipality or
            municipalities such portion of the cost thereof as the county commissioners shall
            deem reasonable.  Section 2656.  Entry of Municipal Bridge on Record as County Bridge.--Whenever a public bridge has
            been built or maintained by [any municipality, or by any two municipalities] one or more  municipal corporations , and it shall afterwards appear to the commissioners that the care, maintenance and
            responsibility of said bridge is greater than it is reasonable that the said [political
            subdivisions] municipal corporations should bear, the commissioners may enter such bridge upon record as a county bridge,
            and it shall thereafter be a county bridge in the same manner as if it had originally
            been so entered on record, if the proper local authorities having the maintenance,
            supervision and control of such bridge shall tender the same to the said county [commissioners]
            free and without charge.  20180154u114s  Section 114.  Section 2670 of the act is repealed:  [Section 2670.  Building or Repair of Bridges.--In addition to the provisions of Articles XVIII and
            XXIII of this act relating to contracting for services and personal property, whenever
            the county commissioners propose to build or repair a bridge at a cost in excess of
            ten thousand dollars ($10,000) upon the line between two adjoining counties, the advertising
            shall be done in each of said counties, and a copy of the plans and specifications
            shall be kept in the commissioners' office of each county.]  20180154u115s  Section 115.  Sections 2701, 2702, 2703 and 2704 of the act are amended to read:  Section 2701.  Definitions.--The words defined in section [two thousand six hundred one of this act] 2601 shall be construed to have like meanings when used in this article.

            the county commissioners may[, upon approval by the court of quarter sessions, originally
            lay out and open any road, and take possession of and exercise control over any existing
            township road or part thereof, and build and maintain roads as county roads within
            their respective limits. They may, at any time, straighten, widen, extend and alter

            control and supervision of the county commissioners. It shall be the duty of the county
            to keep and maintain county roads established under this act and all other county
            roads in repair, the expense thereof to be paid by the county in the manner hereinafter
            provided.  Section 2703.  Acquisition of Rights of Way of Abandoned Railroads.-- (a) The county commissioners [of any county] may take over any abandoned rights of way or bridge
            of a railroad company or any part thereof for the purpose of relocating any existing

            bridge or such part thereof, as may be necessary for the relocating or locating of
            said county road, from the owner thereof[, at a fair price, to be approved by the
            court of quarter sessions of the county].  (b) Whenever [any such] an abandoned right of way or bridge of a railroad company or any part thereof is purchased
            under the provisions of this section, a county road shall be laid out and located
            thereon and shall thereafter be constructed, improved and maintained in accordance
            with law. Any [such] bridge so taken over shall become a county bridge and shall be
            maintained, rebuilt and repaired accordingly.  Section 2704.  Joint Action by Counties.--The provisions of this article may also be exercised jointly
            by adjoining counties as to roads extending along and adjacent to county lines and

            improvements, or they may make the necessary repairs themselves. For the purpose of
            making such repairs, the commissioners may employ or appoint the proper persons and
            buy the necessary materials and buy or rent the necessary machinery.] Maintenance  and repair may be undertaken by contract or through the use of  county personnel, supplies and equipment.

            issued, in the manner provided by this act, upon estimates which shall be made from
            time to time by the persons charged with such duty. The amount and time within which
            the same shall be paid shall be fixed and determined in the contract made for the

            part of any road under their supervision and can agree with the property owners affected
            by such change as to damages, they may, upon payment of the damages agreed upon, construct
            or alter such part of such public road as contemplated in such agreement without the
            formality of a view. [This authority shall not extend to any construction or alteration,
            the cost and expenses of which to such county, including damages, shall exceed one
            thousand dollars ($1000). A petition setting forth the facts, accompanied by a map
            or draft of such proposed change, shall be presented to the court of quarter sessions
            for approval before such actual change is made, whereupon the new location, thus approved

            taking, injuring or destroying property] in accordance with 26 Pa.C.S. (relating to eminent  domain) , after having determined the amount of damages sustained, shall assess the whole
            or such part of such damages as may be represented by benefits upon the properties
            abutting on and benefited by [such] the improvements. The remaining part of such damages, if any, not so assessed against
            the abutting properties, shall be paid by the county. The total assessments for benefits
            shall in no case exceed the total damages awarded and agreed upon.  [The viewers shall in such cases file their report showing the balance struck between
            the damages awarded and the benefits assessed.]  Section 2721.  Improvement of [Borough and Township] Municipal Roads.--Whenever such system of main thoroughfares had been adopted or when the adoption
            thereof is contemplated within two years after the commencement of such improvement,
            the commissioners may[, upon approval by the court of quarter sessions as hereinafter
            provided,] take exclusive control of and improve any road or section thereof located
            either wholly or in part[,] in any [borough or township] municipal corporation , whether existing by their authority or laid out in whole or in part by virtue of

            rendered unnecessary and useless. Any road as established or altered, constructed
            and improved, under the provisions of this section, shall, by ordinance enacted by
            each [borough or by resolution adopted by the commissioners or supervisors of each
            township] municipal corporation through which such road shall pass, become [borough or township] municipal roads, and the duty of maintaining and keeping the same in repair shall devolve upon
            each respective [township or borough] municipal corporation through or into which the same extends.  Section 2722.  Plan of System to Be Followed; Variations.--After such plans have been adopted and
            recorded pursuant to law, all applications under the preceding section [to the court
            of quarter sessions] shall be restricted and shall relate only to the establishing,
            opening, construction and improvement of the proposed roads of said system or parts
            thereof and the vacation of roads supplied by the portion opened and improved. The
            commissioners[, upon approval by the court of quarter sessions as hereinafter provided,]
            may relocate, straighten, widen, extend, alter and open, construct and improve, the
            proposed roads as laid out, surveyed, marked and shown upon the plans of said system,
            or to originally locate, lay out and establish, construct and improve roads which
            substantially supply said system or parts thereof which, although not parts of said
            system, are deemed by the court to be main thoroughfares of sufficient importance
            to be improved by the county and to be added to said plan, and in such case to vacate
            so much of the roads of the system and of roads already established as may be rendered
            unnecessary by the changes or by an entirely new location.  Section 2723.  Improvement of Roads Not Part of System on Contribution From Parties Interested.--The
            commissioners may also originally locate, lay out and establish in whole or in part,
            relocate, straighten, widen, extend, alter and open, construct and improve roads not
            parts of said system nor deemed main thoroughfares, upon parties interested therein
            paying or securing to be paid[, in a manner to be approved by the court of quarter

            defining the nature and character of the improvement reasonably necessary or desirable
            to be made to the roadway, and requiring the parties hereinabove specified to enter
            into a contract or contracts for the making and constructing of the same as herein

            the same procedure as provided by the rules in equity in similar cases, to the court,
            which may reject, confirm or modify the same, and may make its decree or order directing
            the making of such alterations or improvements to the roadway as may be deemed reasonably
            necessary or desirable, and providing for the sharing of the cost of such improvements,
            one-half by the [municipality] municipal corporation and one-half by the county and township, in equal portions.  (d)  Said order or decree may further provide that the repairs to such alterations and
            improvements subsequently required shall be borne one-half by the [municipality] municipal  corporation , whether borough or city, and one-half by the county or township in equal portions,

            find to be legal and proper. Thereupon, the grading, curbing, macadamizing or paving
            of the roadway of such road shall proceed in accordance with the decree or order of
            the said court in the same manner as if the contract or agreement had been entered

               all three members are physically present. Any salary of members of an auxiliary appeal board shall be fixed by the salary board
            of the county.  [(c)  Alternates.--In addition to the appointment of three members to each auxiliary appeal
            board created in accordance with subsection (a), the county commissioners may appoint
            no more than eight alternate members, each of whom may serve as directed by the board
            of assessment appeals on any auxiliary appeal board in the event that a member of
            an auxiliary appeal board is unavailable for a scheduled hearing by reason of being
            absent, having a conflict or being disqualified. Alternate members shall be appointed
            for the same length of time as any auxiliary appeal board is in existence. Any salary
            of alternate members serving on an auxiliary appeal board shall be fixed by the salary
            board of the county. An alternate member shall have the same authority as a member

            appeals from assessments after a countywide revision of assessments or homestead exclusion.]  (d)  Pools.--The county commissioners may create a pool of qualified residents for potential
            service as auxiliary appeal board members. The pool shall be subject to revision or
            rescission at any time by the county commissioners, and pool members shall not be
            entitled to any salary unless serving on an auxiliary appeal board. Pool members may
            serve as directed by the board of assessment appeals on any auxiliary appeal board
            in the event that a member of an auxiliary appeal board is unavailable for a scheduled
            hearing by reason of being absent, having a conflict or being disqualified. Nothing
            in this subsection shall preclude the appointment of qualified auxiliary appeal board
            members from outside of an established pool.  20180155u6s  Section 6.  This act shall take effect January 1, 2020.    APPROVED--The 24th day of October, A.D. 2018.    TOM WOLF   "

            the Army Air Corps in 1940.  (2)  Following the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, Sergeant Emerick was deployed to the Bataan
            Peninsula, Philippines, initially serving in the 19th Air Base Squadron and later
            transferring to the 31st infantry unit in an attempt to halt the Japanese advance
            in the region.  (3)  With limited food, water and supplies, and following the order of his commander, Sergeant
            Emerick, along with approximately 12,000 Americans and 63,000 Filipinos, surrendered
            to Japanese forces as prisoners of war and were forced to march 65 miles through the
            jungle with no food or water. This march would later be known as the Bataan Death
            March.  (4)  Sergeant Emerick survived the death march and 42 months of capture and was rescued
            on September 12, 1945, when United States Forces liberated the prisoners of war.  (5)  Sergeant Emerick was awarded the Bronze Star with ""V"" for valor for heroism during
            combat operations on April 6, 1942, on Bataan. His medals included three Bronze Stars,
            a Purple Heart, three Presidential Unit Citations and a Prisoner of War medal.  (6)  Following his return to the United States, Sergeant Emerick became a commander in
            the American Defenders of Bataan and Corregidor, where he was able to assist former
            prisoners of war in any way he could, including work that led to a study resulting
            in legislation that would become the former Prisoners of War Benefits Act of 1981.  (7)  Sergeant Emerick was a 50-year member of the American Legion Post in Finleyville and
            member of the St. Francis of Assisi Church until his death on September 22, 2009.  (b)  Designation.--The bridge to be constructed on Pennsylvania Route 88 over Peters Creek
