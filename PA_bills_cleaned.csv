            finding   (1)  if the public is provided adequate notice and information about sexually violent predators
            and offenders as well as those sexually violent predators and offenders who do not
            have a fixed place of habitation or abode, the community can develop constructive
            plans to prepare itself for the release of sexually violent predators and offenders 
            this allows communities to meet with law enforcement to prepare and obtain information
            about the rights and responsibilities of the community and to provide education and
            counseling to their children   (2)  these sexually violent predators and offenders pose a high risk of engaging in further
            offenses even after being released from incarceration or commitments, and protection
            of the public from this type of offender is a paramount governmental interest   (3)  the penal and mental health components of our justice system are largely hidden from
            public view, and lack of information from either may result in failure of both systems
            to meet this paramount concern of public safety   (4)  overly restrictive confidentiality and liability laws governing the release of information
            about sexually violent predators and offenders have reduced the willingness to release
            information that could be appropriately released under the public disclosure laws
            and have increased risks to public safety   (5)  persons found to have committed a sexual offense have a reduced expectation of privacy
            because of the public's interest in public safety and in the effective operation of
            government   (6)  release of information about sexually violent predators and offenders to public agencies
            and the general public will further the governmental interests of public safety and
            public scrutiny of the criminal and mental health systems so long as the information
            released is rationally related to the furtherance of those goals   (b)  declaration of policy   it is hereby declared to be the intention of the general assembly
            to   (1)  protect the safety and general welfare of the people of this commonwealth by providing
            for registration, community notification and access to information regarding sexually
            violent predators and offenders who are about to be released from custody and will
            live in or near their neighborhood   (2)  require the exchange of relevant information about sexually violent predators and
            offenders among public agencies and officials and to authorize the release of necessary
            and relevant information about sexually violent predators and offenders to members
            of the general public, including information available through the publicly accessible

            article viii of the constitution of pennsylvania  this may necessitate changes to
            sources of funding and enactment of statutes to achieve full compliance with these

            power of attorney   durable health care power of attorney  and health care treatment instructions  (living will)  part i  introductory remarks on  health care decision making  you have the right to decide the type of health care you want   should you become unable to understand, make or communicate decisions about medical
            care, your wishes for medical treatment are most likely to be followed if you express
            those wishes in advance by   (1)  naming a health care agent to decide treatment for you  and  (2)  giving health care treatment instructions to your health care agent or health care
            provider   an advance health care directive is a written set of instructions expressing your
            wishes for medical treatment   it   notice about anatomical donation  this document may also contain directions regarding whether you wish to donate an
            organ, tissue or eyes  under pennsylvania law, donating a part of the body for transplantation
            or research is a voluntary act  you do not have to donate an organ, tissue, eye or
            other part of the body  however, it is important that you make your wishes about anatomical
            donation known, just as it is important to make your choices about end of life care
            known   surgeons have made great strides in the field of organ donation and can now transplant
            hands, facial tissue and limbs  a hand, facial tissue and a limb are examples of what
            is known as a vascularized composite allograft  under pennsylvania law, explicit and
            specific consent to donate hands, facial tissue, limbs or other vascularized composite
            allografts must be given  you may use this document to make clear your wish to donate
            or not to donate hands, facial tissue or limbs   under pennsylvania law, the organ donor designation on the driver's license authorizes
            the individual to donate what we traditionally think of as organs (heart, lung, liver,
            kidney) and tissue and does not authorize the individual to donate hands, facial tissue,
            limbs or other vascularized composite allografts   detailed information about anatomical donation, including the procedure used to recover
            organs, tissues and eyes, can be found on the department of transportation's internet
            website  information about the donation of hands, facial tissue and limbs can also
            be found on the department of transportation's internet website   you may wish to consult with your physician or your attorney to determine whether
            the procedure for making an anatomical donation is compatible with fulfilling your
            specific choices for end of life care  in addition, you may want to consult with clergy
            regarding whether you want to donate an organ, a hand, facial tissue or limb or other
            part of the body  it is important to understand that donating a hand, limb or facial
            tissue may have an impact on funeral arrangements and that an open casket may not
            be possible   an advance health care directive may contain a health care power of attorney, where you name a person called a ""health
            care agent"" to decide treatment for you, and a living will, where you tell your health
            care agent and health care providers your choices regarding the initiation, continuation,
            withholding or withdrawal of life sustaining treatment and other specific directions regarding end of life  care and your views regarding organ and tissue donation    you may limit your health care agent's involvement in deciding your medical treatment
            so that your health care agent will speak for you only when you are unable to speak
            for yourself or you may give your health care agent the power to speak for you immediately 
            this combined form gives your health care agent the power to speak for you only when
            you are unable to speak for yourself  a living will cannot be followed unless your
            attending physician determines that you lack the ability to understand, make or communicate
            health care decisions for yourself and you are either permanently unconscious or you
            have an end stage medical condition, which is a condition that will result in death
            despite the introduction or continuation of medical treatment  you, and not your health
            care agent, remain responsible for the cost of your medical care   if you do not write down your wishes about your health care in advance, and if later
            you become unable to understand, make or communicate these decisions, those wishes
            may not be honored because they may remain unknown to others   a health care provider who refuses to honor your wishes about health care must tell
            you of its refusal and help to transfer you to a health care provider who will honor
            your wishes   you should give a copy of your advance health care directive (a living will, health
            care power of attorney or a document containing both) to your health care agent, your
            physicians, family members and others whom you expect would likely attend to your
            needs if you become unable to understand, make or communicate decisions about medical
            care  if your health care wishes change, tell your physician and write a new advance
            health care directive to replace your old one  if your wishes about donating an organ, tissue or eyes  change, tell your physician and write a new advance health  care directive to replace your old one  if you do not wish to  donate a hand, facial tissue or limb, it is important to make  that clear in your advance health care directive or health  care power of attorney, or both  it is important in selecting a health care agent that you choose a person you trust
            who is likely to be available in a medical situation where you cannot make decisions
            for yourself  you should inform that person that you have appointed him or her as
            your health care agent and discuss your beliefs and values with him or her so that
            your health care agent will understand your health care objectives    , including whether you want to limit or  withhold life sustaining measures in the event that you  become permanently unconscious or have an end stage medical  condition  you should also tell your health care agent  whether you want to donate organs, tissue, eyes or other  parts of the body and whether you want to make a donation of  your hands, facial tissue or limbs  it is important to  understand that if you decide to donate a hand, limb or  facial tissue it may impact funeral arrangements and that an  open casket may not be possible   you may wish to consult with knowledgeable, trusted individuals such as family members,
            your physician or clergy when considering an expression of your values and health

            your wishes regarding medical treatment  the following form is an example of an advance

            decisions for you whenever you cannot make them for yourself  it is also designed
            to express a desire to limit or authorize care if you have an end stage medical condition
            or are permanently unconscious  if you do not desire to give your health care agent
            broad powers, or you do not wish to limit your care if you have an end stage medical
            condition or are permanently unconscious, you may wish to use a different form or
            create your own  you should also use a different form if you wish to express your
            preferences in more detail than this form allows or if you wish for your health care
            agent to be able to speak for you immediately  in these situations, it is particularly

            alzheimer's disease  do you want medical care applied aggressively in these situations
            or would you consider such aggressive medical care burdensome and undesirable?  you may choose whether you want your health care agent to be bound by your instructions
            or whether you want your health care agent to be able to decide at the time what course
            of treatment the health care agent thinks most fully reflects your wishes and values   if you are a woman and diagnosed as being pregnant at the time a health care decision
            would otherwise be made pursuant to this form, the laws of this commonwealth prohibit
            implementation of that decision if it directs that life sustaining treatment, including
            nutrition and hydration, be withheld or withdrawn from you, unless your attending
            physician and an obstetrician who have examined you certify in your medical record
            that the life sustaining treatment   (1)  will not maintain you in such a way as to permit the continuing development and live
            birth of the unborn child   (2)  will be physically harmful to you  or  (3)  will cause pain to you that cannot be alleviated by medication   a physician is not required to perform a pregnancy test on you unless the physician
            has reason to believe that you may be pregnant   pennsylvania law protects your health care agent and health care providers from any
            legal liability for following in good faith your wishes as expressed in the form or

            a pennsylvanian will die of cancer every 10 minutes  african american pennsylvanians
            in particular face higher rates of cancer incidence and mortality compared to other
            races and ethnicities   (2)  the ability to translate medical findings from research to practice relies largely
            on having robust and diverse patient participation in cancer clinical trials   (3)  a low participation rate or a homogenous participant group prevents segments of the
            population from benefiting from advances achieved through clinical research, creates
            uncertainties over the applicability of research findings and has proven to develop
            lifesaving drugs that work for some ethnic populations but not others   (4)  conversely, some drug trials are canceled because they do not show promise for the
            current homogenous study population of patients but could be beneficial to other ethnicities
            who are not receiving the trial drug because of poor participation rates   (5)  diverse patient participation in cancer clinical trials depends, in part, on whether
            a participant can afford ancillary medical and other costs, including transportation
            for clinical visits required by trial participation, which are not covered by standard
            of care, or lodging during the course of his or her participation  a national study
            in 2015 found that patient households making less than  50,000 annually were almost
            30  less likely to participate in clinical trials   (6)  another barrier to cancer clinical trial participation is the cost of travel, lodging
            and other expenses for a patient's travel companion, including a family member, friend,
            health care provider or chaperone that attends cancer clinical trial treatments to
            provide emotional, physical and mental support to the trial participant  some trial
            participants are too old, too young or too ill to simply travel on their own   (7)  cancer clinical trials often only cover the actual cost of the drug being tested and
            very rarely the direct costs of participation by a patient subject  there are often
            significant expenses associated with enrollment in a clinical trial that are not covered
            by the clinical trial site or sponsor  these include travel expenses to and from the
            clinical sites whether by air, car, bus, train, taxi or public transportation along
            with the travel costs of parking, car rental, gas, tolls and lodging   (8)  this disparity threatens one of the most basic ethical underpinnings of clinical research,
            the requirement that the benefits of research be made available equitably among all
            eligible individuals   (9)  according to the national cancer institute, cancer clinical trials resource guide,
            some of the barriers preventing individuals, with cancer or at high risk of developing
            cancer, from participating in clinical trials are direct and indirect financial and
            personal costs, including travel   (10)  some corporations, individuals, public and private foundations, health care providers
            and other stakeholders are hesitant to contribute to or accept funds from programs
            that are organized to alleviate financial burdens faced by patients who wish to participate
            in clinical trials and their caregivers due to concerns that the united states food
            and drug administration or other federal regulators would view the payments made from
            those funds as prohibited inducements for patients to receive the health care services
            provided during clinical trials   (11)  while the united states food and drug administration recently confirmed to congress
            and provided guidance that, in fact, reimbursement of direct patient incurred expenses
            is not inducement, many organizations, pharmaceutical companies, philanthropic individuals,
            charitable organizations, government entities and others still operate under the understanding
            that such reimbursement could be, in fact, considered inducement   (b)  intent   it is the intent of the general assembly to enact legislation to define and
            establish a clear difference between what is considered inducement for a patient to
            participate in a clinical trial and direct reimbursement of patient incurred expenses

            as a result of a fiscal emergency is determined to affect adversely the health, safety
            and welfare not only of the residents of the city, but also of other residents of
            this commonwealth   (b)  legislative intent     (1)  it is the intent of the general assembly to   (i)  provide cities of the third class with the legal tools with which they can perform
            essential municipal services  and  (ii)  foster sound financial planning and budgetary practices for cities of the third class,
            which cities will be charged with the responsibility to exercise efficient and accountable

            manner with the elected officers of cities of the third class   20180124u103s  section 103   legislative findings   it is hereby determined and declared as a matter of legislative finding that   (1)  some cities of the third class have encountered recurring financial difficulties that

            health, safety and general welfare of residents of those cities   (2)  it is critically important that cities of the third class maintain their creditworthiness   (3)  due to the economic and social interrelationship among all residents in our economy,
            the fiscal integrity of cities of the third class is a matter of concern to all residents
            of this commonwealth, and the financial problems of these cities have a direct and
            negative effect on the entire commonwealth   (4)  because cities of the third class consume a substantial proportion of the products
            of pennsylvania's farms, factories, manufacturing plants and service enterprises,
            economic difficulties confronting cities of the third class detrimentally affect the
            economy of the commonwealth as a whole and become a matter of statewide concern   (5)  because residents of cities of the third class contribute a substantial proportion
            of all commonwealth tax revenues, a disruption of the economic and social life of
            these cities may have a significant detrimental effect on commonwealth revenues   (6)  the financial difficulties of cities of the third class can best be addressed and
            resolved by cooperation between governmental entities   (7)  the constitution of pennsylvania grants municipalities authority to cooperate with
            other governmental entities in the exercise of any function or responsibility   (8)  the commonwealth retains certain sovereign powers with respect to cities of the third
            class, among them the powers to authorize and levy taxes, to authorize the incurring
            of indebtedness and to provide financial assistance that may be necessary to assist
            cities in solving their financial problems   (9)  the commonwealth may attach conditions to grants of authority to incur indebtedness
            or assistance to cities of the third class in order to ensure that deficits are eliminated
            and access to capital markets is achieved and maintained   (10)  the conditions must be incorporated into intergovernmental cooperation agreements
            between the commonwealth or its instrumentalities and cities of the third class   (11)  cities of the third class and the commonwealth will benefit from the creation of an
            independent authority composed of members experienced in finance and management that
            advises the cities, the general assembly and the governor concerning solutions to
            fiscal problems cities of the third class may face   (12)  the creation of an authority will allow cities of the third class to continue to provide
            the necessary municipal services for their residents and to contribute to the economy

            to the investigation or prosecution that resulted in the judgment of conviction   (2)  the evidence may have been discovered either prior to or after the applicant's conviction 
            the evidence shall be available for testing as of the date of the motion  if the evidence
            was discovered prior to the applicant's conviction, the evidence shall not have been
            subject to the dna testing requested because the technology for testing was not in
            existence at the time of the trial or the applicant's counsel did not seek testing
            at the time of the trial in a case where a verdict was rendered on or before january
            1, 1995, or the  evidence was subject to the testing, but newer technology  could provide substantially more accurate and substantially  probative results, or the applicant's counsel sought funds from the court to pay for the testing because
            his client was indigent and the court refused the request despite the client's indigency   (3)  a request for dna testing under this section shall be by written petition and shall
            be filed with the clerk of courts of the judicial district where the sentence is imposed   (4)  dna testing may be sought at any time if the motion is made in a timely manner and

            subsection (c)(2) or the court from making a determination and ordering dna testing
            under subsection (d)(2)   (6)  the motion shall explain how, after review of the record of the applicant's trial,
            there is a reasonable possibility if the applicant is under state supervision, or
            there is a reasonable probability if the applicant is not under state supervision,
            or after review of the record of the applicant's guilty plea there is a reasonable
            probability, that the testing would produce exculpatory evidence that would establish   (i)  the applicant's actual innocence of the offense for which the applicant was convicted   (ii)  in a capital case, the applicant's actual innocence of the charged or uncharged conduct
            constituting an aggravating circumstance under section 9711(d) (relating to sentencing

            proceedings that resulted in the applicant's conviction and sentencing  and  (ii)  dna testing of the specific evidence, assuming exculpatory results, would establish   (a)  the applicant's actual innocence of the offense for which the applicant was convicted   (b)  in a capital case, the applicant's actual innocence of the charged or uncharged conduct
            constituting an aggravating circumstance under section 9711(d) if the applicant's
